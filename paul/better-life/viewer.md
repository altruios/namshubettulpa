# VIEWER

the viewer is the client applicaton to read and write into the blockchains and represent them visually.


the viewer / validator for the blockchain stacks. actions are validated by other clients - with a concensus agreement of what actions are possible at a given time.

a client viewer may for example try to issue to the network a block where the player movement is double speed, or malicious code injection - the honest clients reject the block as invalid - and the originator client's view is converted to the majority's view.
