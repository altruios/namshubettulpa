# REDEYE

mn:M
~Martha was walking on top of a cliff face~
~The wind in her face and the sun on her back~
~In front of her was a long cylindrical spacecraft~
~It jutted out from the crash site at the side of the cliff below her~
~It was covered with hexagonal glass windows~
~The entire shape bubbled out in strange directions - not aerodynamic at all~
*She made her decent, until landing on the top of the ship*
~To her right was an entrance: a broken hub of glass~
~Some sort of window~
*Navigating the broken glass she rolled as gently as she could inside the ship*
~Inside the emergency lights were a steady red~
~She had no flashlight~
~A long hallway descending deep into the mountain~
~Side doors, broken off their hinges covered the floor~
*She descended into the red*
~The end of the tunnel was blocked off~
~Jammed shut by a door she couldn't move~
~To her right was a service hatch~
~It was half way down and half her size~
~A crawlspace for the electrics~
*She popped it open and a hiss of air came out*
~It had an odor to it: stale, damp~
~Of dead mold and old things~
*She crawled in*
~She was on her hands and knees - struggling to move forward~
~The tunnel clearly not meant for her size~
~The walls jutted out in strange directions from the crash~
~They reminding her of the sliding mechanism for a drawer~
~Only much more jagged~
~The red lights shown in here too - dimmer than the main passage.
Fading into a dark hole in front of her~
~As she grew closer she saw the opening was a narrow spot~
~One she just barely fit though~
~Beyond was a short circular room the shape of a coin~
*She tumbled out, hunching over doing a sort of crab walk to continue on*
~She heard rustling behind her~
*Turning, she found nothing*
~To her right was a squeak, she found it - a small rodent~
'How was she going to get it out?'
~It sat on its hind legs and was a cross between a squirrel and a beaver~
~Grey in color with extremely large eyes, wider than she had ever seen~
~Those eyes looked at her, reflected her in them~
*And it scampered off, to the side of the room*
~There were only two exits~
~Stacked on top of each other~
~The entrance she tumbled though being the one above~
~She heard a noise again, behind her~
~Something large moving in one of the tunnels~
*She fell from the top one, but something was there below*
~A glistening black form, that hid against the busted lights~
~All she could tell was it was moving~
~Toward her~
*She backed against the opposite side of the room*
*The rodent scampered away from her*
*It changed direction back towards her as a figure slammed into the threshold*
*Clawing at it, trying to get through, though it was too big*
~She couldn't make it out~
~But it had a long row of teeth that she could see~
~Reflecting purely the red light~
~Its head could not fit through the opening~
~And its tiny claw couldn't swipe far enough to reach her~
*It opened its mouth*
*And another set of teeth reached out with an appendage in its mouth*
~She stared at it, it couldn't reach her and she could only watch~
*The rodent by her side was terrified*
~The only way out now was just above the creature - the way she had come~
'Where had she seen this before?'
~She felt a familiar tinge of nostalgia~
}
{
~She felt herself sliding back - through the metal~
*She kept falling backwards - further into the mountain*
~The rock twisted and became sparse~
~Purple lightning strikes between the dust particles swirling about in the air~
*She twisted around to see she was heading towards a barrier*
~Something like a soap bubble~
~The torrent wailed against her until she passed that threshold~
~Then all was silence as she slowly fell toward the deck of the ship below~
~She angled herself to be standing when she landed~
~Memory flooding back into her~
~That she was in a dream, that she had been here before~
~And before her stood captain Alacira, smiling~
"A::First things first, put this in your ear. 
Then think of the last place I sent you..."
*She handed Martha a small brass*
'Horn?'
*She took it and did as instructed, remembering the monastery with the monks*
~A swirling cloud of color poured out of the horn~
~And behind her Gerald Whitewater was there to capture that with a jar~
*He closed the lid - and took the horn from Martha*
"G::Just in case we forgot something..."
*Taking both carefully while also balancing a clipboard under his arm*
"A::Same time frame as before - what was it this time?"
"M::What?"
"A::What was the thing in your head posing as this time?"
"M::An alien."
~The words came to her - remembering that movie~
*Alacira nodded, moving back to the center of the ship, and Martha followed*
"A::That thing...
It's not what you see, it's just wearing a costume. 
Don't make assumptions about what's underneath based on what it wears. 
Where to Gerald?"
*Gerald stumbled about - shifting the horn and clipboard's place*
*He lifted a few pages*
"G::13,i4...
You'll have a navigator this time, make sure to stay with him - alright?"
~They reached the elevator at the end of the narrow hall~
"M::Navigator?"
"A::Grab the railing."
*Alacira punched in the numbers on the panel*
"A::He's waiting at the entrance."
*Gerald shuffled the horn between his legs*
*He tucked in the clipboard back under his armpit as they ascended*
*He placed his hand on the railing*
*Martha fell into the side of the elevator*
*Gerald reached out for her*
~She felt her stomach lurch at a sudden weightless sensation~
~The clipboard went flying to the ceiling~
*Gerald grabbed her hand - and placed it on the railing*
*She fell into him*
*She looked up at the clipboard*
*It was barreling back toward her and Gerald caught it*
~Almost nonchalantly~
~Almost~
*He caught it with his face first, then his free hand*
"M::What was that?"
"G::We had to rotate a bit, that's what the railing is for."
"A::Do as I say, when I say...
Get used to that...
We don't have time to explain everything to you...
Just what you need to know."
*The doors opened*
}
{
~Beyond them was a hallway stretching on into the dark like before~
~But this one was lined with snow globes: glowing with a faint blue static~
~In front of them - to the right, was a man she could have sworn she recognized~
~A tall thin man in an overcoat - rubbing the back of his head~
~She just couldn't place him~
"M::The navigator?"
*He bowed*
"G::He doesn't speak."
*Gerald brushed path both of them*
}
{
~He stopped at a single dark and empty snow globe~
*He placed the horn on top of it and emptied the jar's contents into the horn*
~Below the snow globe began to glow~
~Looking inside she could see the monastery as it had been just before the fire~
"G::These are...
...Dreams.
Some of them the last anyone has had."
}
{
"A::Gerald - which number?"
"G::Right."
*He glanced back at his clipboard*
"G::42.
It's on our right."
~The only lights that flickering blue from the snow globes~
"M::I swear I know you."
~Martha studied the tall man~
*He looked at her, shrugged, then looked at alacira quizzically*
"G::I doubt it - unless you know many coma patients?"
*Martha shook her head - still staring at the navigator*
~It was on the tip of her brain~
"G::We're here."
}
{
~Looking at the gold plate inlaid below Martha saw it read 42~
~The snow globe lay on the pedestal before her.
It showed a network of twisting interlocking gears~
"M::What am I looking for - another book?"
*Gerald shook his head*
"G::This one might be harder to find...
We don't exactly know this time.
This isn't going to be like your last time...
This is far less solid.
It's a dream...
My dream actually...
So out of place things...
Are less out of place there..."
*Gerald gestured toward the navigator who straightened his tie*
"A::That's why he's going with you."
~Captain Alacira studied at her pocket watch~
~Martha heard a small crash in the distance, like thunder only deeper~
"G::That's the first threshold - we can't keep her here much longer."
*Gerald nodded*
}
{
"A::If you get in trouble: Kent here will take you back."
*Gerald took her hand and placed it in the navigator's*
*And before Martha could speak - he placed both on the snow globe*
"G::Good luck!"
~Was the last she heard before a feeling of cold ice permeated her skin~

}
{
~Kent watched the evening's flight unfold~
~He had seen what was on Felix's phone~
~And he played along - following literally everyone else's lead~
'Why were they all doing the same thing?'
'Was this a case of a mass confidence trick?'
'No - this was something else...'
~Everyone's right eye had twitched and then they donned a blank stare~
~When it was his turn he faked the same - he was sure the other's weren't faking~
}
{
~Felix - he learned his name - was an ass~
~Doing childish games with the completely docile passengers~
~Ordering them about for his amusement~
~Kent grew sick at some of the games~
~Thankful he was in the back: far away from Felix~
}
{
~He had to pee, he had to sleep~
~And yet he could do neither without blowing his cover~
~His vision was blurry, and his bladder pressed at him begging for release~
~He wished he stopped by the restroom first thing, but~
'Too late for that.'
}
{
~When Felix wasn't looking in his direction: He did an old army trick~
*He shifted his leg over the other*
*Quietly and carefully he squeezed them together*
~It barely helped~
}
{
~It was another hour before Felix grew uninterested~
~Eventually Felix leaned his chair back to go to sleep~
~No one else moved a muscle~
*When he was sure he was asleep - Kent danced over the still passengers*
~He moved as quietly as he could without releasing his bladder accidentally~
*He made his way back to the restroom in the back of the plane*
~He did not trust the restroom in front next to Felix to be quiet enough~
*He walked into coach*
~Before him everyone was unnaturally still~
}
{
*He made his way down the aisle*
'Pretend they are normal - talking with each other.'
*He opened the door to the bathroom*
~Unsurprisingly the staff in the back were also completely still~
*He shuddered and closed the door*
*While washing his hands his holster sagged just a little, he had a thought*
}
{
*He finished drying his hands*
*He went out into coach and started looking at the passengers,*
~Really looking at them~
'K::Which one are you, damn it?'
*He thought, moving slowly across the middle seats*
~He imagined they would be near the back~
~With a good view of everyone else~
*But frisking everyone so far yielded nothing*
*Methodically he made his way towards the front of the plane: looking for*
~His right hand felt something solid~
~It was underneath the jacket of the man in the window seat about half way up~
"K::Sorry about this..."
*He unbuttoned the sky marshal's jacket and took the glock*
"K::I'll send it back..."
*Kent awkwardly reached around and felt at the man's ass*
~There was no wallet~
*Checking his coat next Kent found a billfold in his inner breast pocket*
*He snapped a picture of the license with his phone then placed it back*
}
{
*He put the gun into his holster*
*Then he walked quietly back to first class: desperate to get some sleep*
~And he realized~
~No one had their eyes closed~
~Could he afford to sleep right now~
~No - no he could not~
*He sighed, and walked to the back of the plane*
}
{
~He was pretty sure they had coffee~
~Or at least the ability to make coffee~
'somewhere in the back of the plane.'
}

}
{
*Martha landed in the center of a golden metal gear*
*She braced her fall while the navigator slowly floated down to meet her*
"M::Kent?"
*He nodded*
~It came flooding back~
~The cop at the precinct - the one who was immune to hooks~
'What was he doing here?'
"M::Why are you here?! 
Are you following me?"
}
{
"NT::  $Edidnotmeet:"
~He didn't speak - not with words~
~But his hands, his whole body even, were excellent at conveying meaning~
~A regular charlie chaplin~
*The floor below them twisted*
~All around them were spinning interlocking gears, fading into blackness~
~There was no obvious light source~
~There was just a faint glow all around that grew dimmer with distance~
}
{
~Martha regained her balance~
~Kent - or the navigator - just stood there easily keeping his~
"NT::$Eshrug:, $Efollow:"
*He walked off to the edge of the gear*
*He looked back with an expectant look*
"M::Where are we going?"
"NT:: $Emydeath:"
*Then he stepped over the ledge*
*He twisted strangely in the air to stand on the edge of the giant gear*
~He was on the teeth of the gear - perpendicular to Martha~
*Martha went to the edge of the gear*
*The navigator walking slowly back toward where the teeth met - waiting for her*
'M::Here goes nothing...'
*She thought, following Kent's leap over the edge*
~She felt herself falling forward, not downward~
'M::Downward is forward...'
~And soon she found herself on top of the teeth~
'M::Shit...'
~She had too much momentum, and then was on the underside of the gear~
}
{
*The Navigator held out his hand over the side*
*He helped her slide back onto the teeth*
~The gear jolted again, backwards toward a set of interlocking teeth~
*She lost her balance and fell backward*
*She landed on the face of the gear* 
~Her leg was longer than the width of the gear's teeth~
~Her foot locked behind two meshed gears~
~Her leg wasn't crushed, but only just~
~She had to wait for the gears to go forward again before pulling her leg out~
*When the teeth rotated enough she threw herself up with Kent's helping hand*
*The Navigator dusted himself off*
"NT::$Ehurryup:..."
~That backwards slippage was only going to get worse~
}
{
~A part of Martha was amazed at how well he communicated - without using words~
*They made their way along the edge*
~Until they met another gear on the other side~
~This one mostly facing to their right~
*With a skip and a hop The Navigator jumped just so - and landed on that gear's teeth*
*With his hand out and some prep time Martha made the jump*
'M::Not so hard this time.'
*When she landed the Navigator more urgently ran - Martha in tow*
}
{
~A moment later the gears skipped backwards again~
~And this time Martha saw a ripple in the other gears around her~
~The wavelike effect gave her some warning~
"M::What's causing that?"
"NT::$Efallapart:"
*They made their way through the gears*
~Each slip getting more jarring~
~Each time the gears fell further back~
'He did say - say? mime: mime it would get worse.'
}
{
~Martha could see stone walls fading in from the void~
"M::Where exactly are we?"
*One of the gears to her right flew towards her - twisting in the air*
*He jumped at her*
*He knocked her to the backside of the gear*
~Opposite where the one flying at her would hit~
~A resounding ringing echoed against her skin~
~The metal below her vibrated and all around her gears started twisting~
~No they were stationary: ~
'Shit - this one was coming loose.'
}
{
*The Navigator pulled her to her feet*
*They ran across the flat to the nearest connected gear*
*Still holding her hand, he grabbed around her back*
*He led them to jump for the face of that gear*
~They landed in an awkward roll, the wind knocked out of Martha~
~She looked back to where they had just been only to see darkness~
~She heard a loud clattering from below~
'Okay, that is just great. 
why is it slipping like that?'
~Which echoed in her right ear, but she was sure that was down at this point~
'Or maybe that way is up?'
~She was lost - they were generally heading up~
*The navigator got up, and helped her to her feet - inspecting her for any damage*
"NT::$Ehurryup:!"
}
{
*He ran - looking back as Martha jolted forward to match his pace*
~She felt something - a dread she remembered from a distant dream~
~!A prickling on the back of the neck.!~
~Not wanting to turn around, not wanting to face it she caught up to the Navigator~
~He had just jumped onto another gear's teeth~
"M::I think it's here."
"NT:: $Eyes:, $Edontlookbehind:"

*She jumped and landed where he was*
~They were running now and Martha noticed the wave of gears slipping~
*She stopped while the Navigator did not*
"M::Wait!"
}
{
*He fell sideways, falling onto the flat of the gear and kept sliding*
*He grabbed the thin metal rod at the center of the gear*
*His hand jerked taught be it kept him from going over the edge*
~He clung to that twisting rod, just taking a moment to breathe~
*He Looked up at Martha - then down below him*
*He started inching his way toward a gear further up that pole*
~He could drop down, which was sideways to Martha, and he could land on it~
"M::I'll come get you!"
"NT::$Eredx:"
*And Martha stopped in her tracks*
~She watched him make his way to the safe landing~
}
{
'Oh shit, that thing is right there!'
~Below the Navigator was a dark figure with a tail~
*It crawled on all fours towards them*
~An alien~
'No...'
~She reminded herself~
'Only a mask.'
'A very convincing mask...'
*She shuddered*
~Well: the second one with how they put people in those nests~
*The Navigator dropped onto the spinning gold gear with a thud*
}
{
*He brushed himself off*
"M::Keep going, it's behind you."
*He looked behind him* 
~The thing was only a few gears away~
*He rushed toward the side*
*He Twisted himself onto the teeth* 
~On a path back toward her~
~Martha could only watch~
~The alien was closing in - he wasn't going to make it~
~She saw the ripple of gears around her -~
"M::Ripple!"
*He held onto the gear*
}
{
~The alien was right behind him~
*The gear flung back and the alien's tail caught in the gears behind it*
*It cried out in a shrieking hiss*
~The metal itself hissed and fumed loudly as the acid ate away~
*The Navigator got to his feet and ran*
*The gears slowly released the alien just as he rushed up to Martha*
~Carefully the Navigator moved past her - and took the lead again~
}
{
~The tail of the creature leaked acid~
~Smoke rose up each time it dropped onto the gears~
~Martha noticed another ripple~
'Okay - that one was way faster...'
*She shouted and they both took cover*
'M::Are they random...'
~The alien was thrown off the same way the Navigator had been a moment earlier~
~It didn't follow them~
'M::Or is it getting faster?'
*Instead it started climbing back up the face of this gear*
}
{
*The Navigator took her hand and they jumped across onto the face of the gear*
~This one was lit differently, bluer - lighter~
~She looked up to see a lack of any more gears to either side~
~One above her connected to the same rod in the center of this gear~
~All around her were stained glass windows~
*He took off his jacket - gave it to her*
*Then he took off his shirt*
*He wrapped it around the rod, then tied it around his wrists*
*He sat down with his legs crossed around the pillar and hugged it*
'M::Pole dancing Kent, navigator of dreams.'
*Suddenly pulled away from the pole and towards the edge of the gear*
*He started climbing*
'M::Follow the leader.'
*She threw the jacket around the pole*
*Then tied it to her wrists*
~The sleeves just long enough to tie in a knot around her arms~
*She crossed her legs around the pillar and made her way up*
~Half way to the top her gravity shifted~
~Not waiting for the gravity to change let her close some distance to the navigator~
}
{
*The alien - the thing, landed on the gear where they just were*
~There was a loud clattering~
~She felt the pole she was climbing spin violently~
~The gear below was loose~
~It gave way into the darkness just as a claw grabbed the rod~
~Its gravity had not changed and it was struggling to hold on~
~To her right she saw a tooth from the gear above her fall~
~A think chunk of metal the size of her forearm~
~It grazed the creature's claw~
~Spilling acid blood that splattered onto the metal rod~
~As it climbed, pieces of the metal dripped away~
~Leaving only its two front claws any purchase to keep climbing~
*Martha kept moving as she looked down*
~They reached the top gear, sliding onto it~
}
{
*They landed on the underside of the gear*
~The navigator was sprawled along the face of the gear~
*Martha began to stand*
"NT::$Estaylow:"
'Okay, staying low.'
~She kept facing the gear, below her was darkness~
"NT::$Efollow:"
*The navigator rolled over the edge, onto the other side*
*Martha followed*
~The gravity shift was ~
~The navigator was standing after a casual flourish~
~Martha stood up, inspecting the top of the gear~
~Empty besides the shiny thing in the center~
~A small marble laid at a small hollow rotating around the center. ~
~It faintly glowed~
~A cat's eye which caught the light~
~It glowed brighter and the gear began to spin~
*Martha was spun nearly to the edge*
}
{
~At her foot another tooth fell - she looked around~
~Only three were remaining - scattered across the perimeter~
*She rushed to the center and grabbed the marble*
~That's what she was here for - that's the only thing that didn't fit~
~Inspecting it she couldn't find anything out of the ordinary with it~
~Other than its glow~
*She rolled it in her hand and there*
~That same kind of symbol~
~Different but undulating and twisting the same way as the one in the book~
}
{
~But her hand was too small to make it out~
*She bent down to roll it across the ground*
~But before she could - the ground lurched beneath her feet~
*The marble slipped from her hand*
*The Navigator with one hand grabbed the marble*
*With the other he grabbed Martha's shirt*
~He was on the other side of the center and together they stayed close~
~Ahead of her - she saw another tooth fall~
"M::Roll it to me!"
*She moved near the edge*
"M::Quickly!"
*He complied and she watched it roll*
'M::The shape inside...'
~Barely even inside it twisted and morphed through a repeating pattern~
~A pattern that burned in her brain~
~It was circular, and repeated itself~
~A story she didn't understand looped over and over~
~As old as time itself~
*She caught the marble, rushing back toward the center*
~In front of her she saw a claw reach over the edge of the gear~
~The metal sizzled beneath it~
"M::We have to go now, how do we get out of here?"
"NT::$Eovertheedge:"
*Another lurching threw them both near the creature*
~Not directly at it: off to its side~
*They rolled over the edge and felt gravity shift*
*They landed on the bear gear - where teeth used to be*
~Martha saw themselves reflected in creature's eyes~
~It was so close~
*Both of them rolled back onto the bottom of the gear, almost out of its reach*
*It grabbed the Navigator's face - with the cut hand*
*Acid poured onto him and he let out a silent scream*
*He kicked at the alien and braced his back against the gear*
*Its gravity shifted sideways, and the creature narrowly missed Martha*
*She pulled him away*
~She heard a screech from across the gear~
~A sizzling of metal, she did not look~
*Laying him down she dabbed at his face with the only rag she had*
~The jacket she still had tied to her arms~
~Most of it was gone now but the damage done~
~His face horribly ruined~
~And it was still sizzling - hissing~
*She dabbed at it again, unable to wipe it away, more just wiping it around*
*She threw the jacket away*
~It too hissed and steamed and gurgled~
~Like his face~
~He wasn't moving anymore - but he was still breathing~
~The creature was climbing up now, across the side of the gear~
*She dragged Kent over the edge to the top of the top gear*
*She dragged him in the center*
~She waited until she saw the claw reach over~
*She felt the lurch again, adjusted herself and kent to be swung towards the side*
'M::Just hold on there, back the way we came...'
~He was rasping a breath~
"M::Can you get us out of here now?"
~Martha looked back at that thing chasing her, still coming toward her~
~She felt a small adjustment on her side, a movement~
'Where had that...'
*She looked down*
"NT::$Edown:"
*His hand fell limp*
'M::Shit...'
*And she jumped with all her strength*
~With the Navigator - Kent - in tow~
*She flew over the edge just as the alien at the center of the gear*
*She fell - down*
~There were no more gears - just remnants of where they once had been~
~A few golden rods jutted out from the walls~
~Several just narrowly missed them~
*They continued to fall into the blackness*
~Down below where there were no more rods~
~And she noticed a flicker of purple in the background~
~The darkness faded into a misty grey~
~Twisting about her as a mist - the storm growing~
~Thunder echoed all around her in the distance~
*Lightning struck just a few feet away from them*
~It crackled and made all the hair on her skin stand up~
~And a ringing in her ears~
}
{
~They fell through the barrier - silence engulfed them~
~The Navigator wasn't moving - she held him tight~
~They landed on the deck of the ship~
~Captain alacira standing there~
~Whitewater behind her~
*Martha knelt over Kent*
"M::He's hurt!"
~He didn't get up~
~He didn't move~
*Alacira rushed over - and moved her out of the way*
}
{
"A::We got it from here."
*She shouted for a medic* 
*And one came in rushed in from below deck*
~A doctor with a big black purse - the kind from Victorian times~
*He bent over to see Kent - pushing Martha back onto her feet*
"A::Did you get it?"
*Alacira looked back up at Martha, who nodded*
*The marble exited her pocket to her hand then to Alacira who inspected it*
}
{
"A::Good job...
He'll be fine."
*She looked behind her and nodded*
"A::Send her back."
*Martha turned around*
~Behind her was a giant tribal mask~
*It was shaking back and forth - behind it was Gerald's voice going:*
"G::Uhh ga booga booga!"
~Startling her awake~
}
{
~The plane was landing~
