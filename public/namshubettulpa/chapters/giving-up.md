~Kent was at Martha's side~
*He shook Martha's shoulder*
'K::No reaction.'
~She wasn't moving, not even breathing~
"K::She's not breathing!"
"FL__F::It was probably Al-tok."
"RG__JL::Who was she?"
"K::Is."
'K::Present tense'
*Kent reached down and felt for a pulse*
"NT:: 📢📣🗣️💬 > 🔎"
'K::And the look alike is dancing nonsense...'
"K::She still has a pulse"
'K::CPR, Kent? 
You going to do that?'
~He didn't have to, Martha woke with a start~
*She took in a lungful. 
Panting, she stood up*
~Martha's face was blank, but her eyes darted over each of them.
They landed on Alacira~
~Kent saw on Alacira and Whitewater's wrists each a bail~
*Each bail rattled, glowing a white-blue*
