~Kent was at Martha's side~
*He shook Martha's shoulder*
'K::No reaction.'
~She wasn't moving, not even breathing~
"K::She's not breathing!"
"FL__F::It was probably Al-tok."
"RG__JL::Who was she?"
"K::Is."
'K::Present tense'
*Kent reached down and felt for a pulse*
"NT:: 📢📣🗣️💬 > 🔎"
'K::And the look alike is dancing nonsense...'
"K::She still has a pulse"
'K::CPR, Kent? 
You going to do that?'
~He didn't have to, Martha woke with a start~
*She took in a lungful. 
Panting, she stood up*
~Martha's face was blank, but her eyes darted over each of them.
They landed on Alacira's hard stare~
~Kent saw on Alacira and Whitewater's wrists each a bail~
*Each bail rattled, glowing a white-blue*

~Martha first felt the sensation of falling through a cold dark fog, wind whipping around her skin.
Her struggles futile, a panic filled her, as slowly she remembered her passing out~
'M::Okay, so is this in my head?'
*She took off a sock and held it in her hand*

`
~The fog reflected the light, surrounding her in a glow~
'M::That thing...'
~...Inside her head, that rossin was keeping at bay, took over...
And yet she was still here...
Somewhere in her head...
She just had to get out~
"M::ROSSIN?"
~There was no echo, no indication of any structure or walls in the distance... just a constant wind~
`
~Self~.~gravity~=0;
`
~The wind stopped, and an eerie silence blanked her~
~She breathed, and tried to calm down, knowing the monster was active and somewhere in her head...~
~She looked at herself, dressed as she was: she briefly considered if clothes were part of her identity or not, and as she did, they winked in and out of existence~
~Startled, she tried again...~
'M::It is my mind after all, I get to make up the rules...'
*She breathed in*
~She didn't know that for sure, but she figured it was a good guess, and she still felt a little hungry...~
'M::That floor, that room. 
They are part of me...'
~She concentrated on the floorboards... the room - Flanagan's study -  as an extension to herself the same way her clothes were~
*She floated in the center as the room constructed itself from her*
~Floorboards, wallpaper, couches, the desk, all flew into place ripping from her regenerating skin~
"M::Okay..."
'M::Now you are in a box, you are the box...
What good did that do?'

pov of martha's reset-3, rossin dying

the Relux/Redlux capture a small chainsaw, deconstruct it, and devise a way to solve it - killing the 'primary' chain saw probably?
