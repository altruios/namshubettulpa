~Every night Wilbert Barley slept he tried his hardest to dream.
Since the car crash, every night was a blank void... 
That is until he discovered he could stay awake, when falling asleep~
'WB::When will it hit?'
~He kept his eyes focused on the ceiling, unmoving, concentrating.
Since the accident, he could not imagine...
He could not dream~
*The alarm buzzed*
~Which signaled another 2 hours had passed~
*Wilbert sighed, rolled over and reset it.
He gagged at the uncovered stench from raising his arm*
'WB::To be expected...'
~He had two energy shots right before bed, 500mg of caffeine. 
He needed the energy - to try to dream again: he was going to make it work this time.
The caffeine gave him energy to resist falling asleep during the process of... falling asleep~
*Wilbert set the alarm for 3am, and rolled back into the soft impression left in his bed*
~He could only attempt this once a week. 
Caffeine lost its effectiveness after day three, the fourth day on was combating withdrawal symptoms.
So he gave it a week, resetting his tolerance...~
*Wilbert kept perfectly still.
Laying on his back, he fought the urge to scratch his nose*
~It took only moments for his body to lock up in that pre-sleep paralysis.
And only minutes for the first wave of sleep to come drag him under.~
*The wave crashed into him*
~And he was left with the distinct impression of being battered against a tidal storm, cold dark water come to drag him under.
He resisted - caffeine finally kicking in - and was rewarded with the sensation of warmth, and floating freely just below the surface.
The first wave had passed, and the second would come.~
*Wilbert came up for breath*
~His breathing was no longer automatic.
Wilbert tried for months, but as a consequence of staying conscious, his mind was tasked with more responsibility~
*Wilbert controlled his breathing, and took in a breath*
'WB::In...and out...'
~He repeated the mantra.
It helped keep him in the here and now, focused on trying to dream~
*Wilbert tested his arm, trying to lift it and finding resistance*
~He knew how much it would take to break that resistance, and he stopped just short of that.
If he would let his mind wander - wonder into some unknown - a wave would take him under: until that alarm on his phone woke him~
~He couldn't let that happen.
This time he would be brave...~
'WB::Are dreams really this important?'
~The next wave of sleep would come soon.
And with it more responsibility. 
By staying awake through the process of falling asleep: more of his autonomous functions fell under his direct control.
His breathing, for example~
'WB::In... and out.'
~Wilbert sensed the swirling sea of sleep begin to churn, a wave was growing.
The force of it greater than the first.
After this next wave he would have to control his heart.
Beat for beat...~
'WB::Just focus on breathing, not what comes next.'
~He never stayed asleep long after that. 
The first time it jarred him awake when his heart stopped beating.
The second time he tried, Wilbert realized what he needed to do and panicked. 
He was messing with things that should be left alone~
'WB::It will be worth it.'
~He knew there was a third wave, one that he would always crash into...~
*Wilbert braced himself against the second wave of sleep as it crashed into him*
~It was like a warm blanket smothering his resistance, thick and indomitable~  
*Wilbert's clenched mind took control of his heart.
He made it beat*
~he didn't play the drums, nor was he in a band: he could barely keep time with music.
Often times he would accidentally wake himself up at this point.
But practice makes perfect~
*Wilbert beat his heart as the wave slowly dissipated*
~He kept rhythm, he kept his time, and in the dark he noticed something sublime~
'WB::Oh.'
~He could see a light, so similar to a flashlight shining on a closed eyelid.
But he was alone, and in his bed room with tinfoil taped to the windows.
The light had a dark spot in the center and Wilbert struggled to make it out.
He could swear that black dot was moving, getting closer~
*A ship descended into his vision*
~It was metal, titanic, and oddly shaped at the top - held aloft above him by a giant propeller blade.
As it lowered he saw it had come though some hole in his vision: perforated like a paper by a pencil~
~Those holes he now could make out thanks to the light spilling in. 
They dotted his vision, all were dark voids.
Tunnels into nothing.
The light, he realized was emanating from the ship: not the hole behind it~
~He could tell it was looking at him, the ship - somehow - was looking at him, not just whoever was piloting it~
*He tracked it flying across his mind, trying to keep track of it with his eyes and failing*
'WB::Wait!'
~Wilbert felt a ripping sensation~ 
*A piece of him - torn and stretched - followed the ship, captured by some chain and hook*
*The ship faded into the distance, entering one of the dark tunnels. 
A ghostly outline of himself followed into that nothing*
~The light of the ship faded in the distance.
It felt like it was taking his dreams with the ship.
He felt his energy vanish~
*Wilbert kept his heart beating*
~It was all he could do.
And he felt the growing churning of his mind again.
A raging tempest, carrying sharp things... 
Things that wouldn't cut or hurt if he had given in by now.
This is as far as he got, usually the pain drove him under, this sleep was no gentle embrace but a desperate scream.
He had no energy to resist~
*The wave crashed into him, and Wilbert fell asleep*

~Ozmind stood upon the deck of the end's dreadnought, surveying his prize.
With a skeletal crew, it was easy to capture, even if he was only one...
And even if he was a shadow of himself...
He pushed those thoughts away~
'O::It needs fuel.'
~With the fuel source - dreams from the passengers - gone, piloting it was difficult.
He resorted to punching into other's dreams, and extracted what he needed to get to the next...
it was slow, because it was relational travel, restricted to dreams that were somehow connected~
*The end's dreadnought punctured into another dream.
Dragging fuel - dreams - behind it.*
~When it entered this new dream it did not reach empty space~
*The end's dreadnought lurched to a halt*
~The ship was stuck. 
Thick tendrils, reflective and white were wrapped tightly around the shield.
Forming a lattice around the bubble~
*The shield gave out, collapsing in a flicker into nothing*
~Drained by the weight, and without enough fuel - they finally failed~
*The strands fell - Pulling tightly - wrapped the ship.
The propeller blades caught, stalling and ripping apart in a loud screech*
~Ozmind felt the deck shake from an explosion below.
He caught the sent of smoke from the engines billow up~
"O::Shit..."
~He had kept his balance through the ordeal, other's on the deck had not.
The small bits of dream-stuff he could pull from what dreams he could find littered the deck in front of him.
Each taken from a different dream, a small piece, shaped into his will: a crewmate~
*Ozmind walked up to one of the thick strands, inspecting it*
~It was a web, like from a spider~
*Ozmind shivered*
~He worried which mind he had wandered into...
So many had been empty before -this one...
This one was full of spiders~
