## the great awakening

{

mn:K
~Car alarms blared in the distance. 
Echoing in the still air between buildings~
~Acrid tire smoke filled the air~
*Kent moved the unconscious homeless clear of his path*
~He was hunched over the rolling bed, using his leg to adjust the bodies below~
*He pulled the bed forward out of the alley*
~Clearing a path through the alley was easier to do from the front~
~Bodies below lay at unnatural angles.
Clearly by having fell the wrong way~
~The chemist lay unconscious on top of the bed~
*The chemist rolled over, falling into the railing*
~A few uneven surfaces would have been troublesome without the bed's side guards~
'K::They said you were in over your head, Kent'
~Kent exited the alley approaching the street. 
Then he saw the fires~
~Cars were still running, but most had crashed.
Many had turned over on the sides of streets~
'K::They were fucking right'
*Kent walked down the sidewalk, pushing the bed*
~He listened~
~There was no sound of life.
No screams, no yelling - no footfalls in the distance~
'K::An air-raid siren would be appropriate'
~He passed a wreck - a car rolled upside down after some impact~
~They were dead, he knew: the cabin had been crushed below human capacity~
~It was a family, he saw that much before he looked away~
"K::HELLO!"
~It was screaming into the wind, but maybe~
~Kent was only around the first corner - he continued on~
~Behind him there was a whistle, loud and sharp: calling~
*Kent turned around*
~He didn't see the source~
"K::HELLO?"
~He called out again~
*A flowerpot burst through a window of a steakhouse*
*Kent ducked behind a line of parked cars*
"F::Over here!"
~He waited and saw Felix poke his head out of the broken window~
'K::Why is he awake?'
~Then a sinking feeling in his stomach appeared~
'K::Did he cause this?'
~He decided that it couldn't have been solely Felix~
'K::No: to many people affected'
"K::What the hell is going on"
"F::No idea"
*Kent pushed the bed towards the steakhouse*
~Felix was at a window seat - eating a steak~
"F::Get some nice beauty sleep, did you?"
*Felix pointed at the bed with is fork*
"F::Making friends?"
~Kent shook his head~
"K::Why aren't you asleep?"
*Felix took another bite of steak*
"F::disconnected - as much as one can be: I assume you are as well"
"K::Disconnected... from?"
"F::The link."
~Kent waited~
'K::The fuck is the link?'
"K::So what happened to the link?"
~He wanted to ask what it was, though felt that unwise~
*Felix shrugged*
"F::Don't know - Flanagan said to disconnect"
'K::Flanagan is a person, good to know'
"K::Are they going to wake up?"
"F::How should I know?"
*Kent parked the bed next to the door and entered the steakhouse*
~Little locking wheels on a hospital bed were useful~
'K::At least the Chemist will stay put'
"K::Who would know?"
"F::Flanagan, either this is him or that Al-tok thing."
*Kent sat at the seat across from Felix*
"K::Al-tok, is that an app?"
"F::Did Martha tell you anything?"
*Kent shook his head*
~Felix sighed and spend the next several minutes catching Kent up to speed~
"K::So this Al-tok this is an idea?"
*Felix twisted his hand out noncommittally*
"F::It isn't human, or a human thought... well, not a natural human thought"
*Felix held out a syringe*
"F::Takes something like this to make anyone think that"
~Kent had a vial of that same liquid - hidden now in his pocket~
"F::Impossible chemicals, for impossible thoughts"
"K::That sounds like bullshit, I can think anything I want to right now"
*Felix shook his head*
"F::No, you can't think any thought you want.
You can't. 
I can't. 
We can only think the thoughts our brains allow."
*Felix took another bite of his steak*
"F::You should eat - if they stay asleep - food won't keep forever."
"K::What you don't believe in free will?"
*Kent sat down at the table across from Felix*
~Kent just watched him eat~
"F::I do, I just don't think free means unrestricted."
"K::That's generally what free means"
"F::Generally"
~Felix took another mouthful of steak~
"K::Chew you goddamn food, people choke on that stuff"
"F::Aren't you going to eat?"
"K::I'll wait.
Shouldn't we be going?"
~Felix continued to talk around mouthfuls of meat~
"F::Yes, but calories first."
~Kent heard screaming in the distance~
*Felix turned his head*
~Listening~
~Kent felt something hit his leg by the ankle~
~Felix had knocked over some people sitting together to get at their food~
*Kent stood up*
*He dodged a twitch of a fallen patron's leg*
'K::People are waking up'
*Kent looked around the room*
~He found movement everywhere~
'K::All of them'
*Kent turn to Felix*
"K::Ah, hell."
*Felix was choking on his food*
~Kent could hear the lack of breathing. 
Felix was unnaturally still, his body on automatic~
"K::Hey, you there?"
~Felix did not respond~
*Kent moved in and applied the heimlich*
~Around him patrons had started to stand up~
*Felix spat up some steak*
~He was still unresponsive but breathing clearly~
'K::The bed has room for two'
*Kent snapped his fingers in front of Felix*
~And when no answer was forthcoming~ 
*Kent handcuffed Felix* 
*And carried him to the bed outside*
~Around him the patrons were confused. 
Some were looking at him and the damage caused.
Others were looking at their own hands~
*Kent put Felix on the bed*
~Next to the chemist~
~He heard a commotion inside~
*He rolled them down the street*
'K::Away from the broken glass'
~He took in a few breaths~
~Around him people were examining the car crashes~
~But there were others: roaming groups descending on the unsuspecting.
It wasn't with guns, or knives or sticks - but words and pictures~
*He pushed the bed down the street*
~It wasn't just one group absorbing another, but multiple each clawing for control of the people of the others. 
Together it was a chaos~
*Kent looked around himself*
~He was at an intersection touching the park~
'K::Okay Kent, where to?'
~He kept an eye out for anyone, any group, approaching him~
'K::Where did Felix come from, Where did you first see him'
~He remembered seeing Felix walking in the park~
~It was a guess, but...~ 
'K::If Felix (and who he was) with was making a bee-line'
*Kent turned left*
'K::Eh, close enough - he can tell me different when he wakes up'
*Kent looked down at Felix*
~He was not moving~
'K::If he wakes up... 
Shit is he still -'
*Felix started coughing*

~It was cramped with seven people in the bubble~
~Martha held tightly to the chair in the center~
~They all were, due to the turbulence~
~Martha didn't see anything outside the bubble, a blank void~
~The bubble was shaking, as if unsure of it's position without any other points of reference~
~A shaky memory, shifting every time it was examined~
"G::I have some bad news, it's worse than we thought"
*Gerald pulled a lever up*
*The ship calmed*
"G::There's nothing out there, no where to go."
~A silence fell over them~
"M::I might have a way."
~Everyone turned their head to Martha, besides Wilbert, whose eye was already on her~
*Alacira gestured for her to continue*
"M::Well, Flanagan did: The way we came into the link, we should be able to get out the same way."
"G::Martha - when I say there's nothing out there, there is nothing, even if we have a way back we wouldn't be able to get to it right now."
"NT::$Ewhichway:"
"M::Through me, through that thing in my head"
*Alacira leaned over and looked at the unconscious Flanagan*
"G::She'd have to go outside the bubble for that"
"A::That's the easy part"
~Sonny was still weaving webs, the glowing sacks stuck to the walls~
~Every addition making the bubble smaller - hotter~
"M::Does anyone have a better idea?"
"G::Waiting it out is less than ideal: we don't know how long this will be"
*Martha looked around the room*
"G::And There is nothing out there."
"A::If there was nothing out there we wouldn't be here in this bubble."
~Alacira was staring out the bubble~
"A::I don't think <i>that</i> nothing out there is nothing.
Just nothing we can use."
*Alacira turned to Gerald and Martha*
"A::She's offering to act like rudolph - light our way home.
A single light in a dark forest attracts the wrong kind of attention."
~She turned to Sonny~
"A::Smaller: marble sized - give them a seam to break at"
*Sonny chittered at the spiders above.*
"A::And a harness for her"
~Alacira pointed at Martha~
"A::What are we looking for?"
~Martha took a moment to think~
"M::A recent memory, outside of a mansion"
*Martha blew out her breath*
"M::Then from there - we go into that hollow, fractal, echo of me.
Up the rabbit hole to the real world."
'M::yes, saying out loud, it sounded crazy.'
~Alacira only nodded~
*Sonny walked up to her and handed her a vest*
~It was made of webs and attached to a rope in the center~
*Martha put it on*
~Martha securing herself, she looked out into that nothing~
*She stepped out of the bubble*
~Her self ripped open, like a ballon with suddenly no pressure~

~Ada walked through the halls of Șolomanță~
~The palace she was in, had a particular quality:~
~Everyone saw their own version of it~
~Everyone knew it was underground the Romanian countryside, but...~
~Were the walls red, or green, or plum?~
~There were details rendered individually by the brains that saw it~
`
[looser details](/namshubettulpa/characters/lovelace/looser-details-fit-more-brains.md)`
~Though many details were indeterminate there were some commonalities~
~The floor was shades of copper, steel, iron, coal, tiled in a  [dragon curve](/namshubettulpa/world/dragon-curve.md), for one~
~And rooms were all the same... 
Well: mostly~
'AD::What a golden opportunity'
~If she wanted she could peruse the library of  [memetic info-hazards](/namshubettulpa/world/memetic-info-hazard.md)~
~It was to her left as she walked down the hall~
~Her heels clacked on the floor and echoed down an otherwise eerie silence~
~Above hung a sign, not of wood, or iron, as most chose to see it, but of fact~
*Dangerous!*
'AD::dangerous for a reason'
~The doors had been opened~
'AD::As long as I use the right filters'
*She looked in*
*Naked facts hung everywhere*
~Facts dangerous to understand, facts that could destroy minds~
~But with the right filters of perception - looked at from only a particular viewpoint - they were safe to consume~
'AD::Well... 
Safe-ish'
*She continued on*
~Part of her wanted to know - things other's have tried to understand only to have been brought to madness~
~But she walked on, content in her brief encounter~
'AD::At least I get to enjoy this silence'
*She stepped over another body*
~All of which occasionally spasmed~
'AD::Which way...'
~To the vault of infectious memes.
[The McCollough effect](/namshubettulpa/world/the-mccollough-effect.md) got out a few decades ago...~
'AD::Or was it a few scores now...'
~Time flew by so quickly the longer you lived~
~It had led to some tools to make someone who was aware (but not awakened) very rich~
'AD::If I cared about making money, or if any of my friends did.'
~No, she decided - up the stairs~
'AD::Onwards to the prize.'
*She climbed them*
~Upstairs was the sovereign's personal development environment~
~Even most people at the gathering didn't know about this room~
'AD::Hell, most people who did know about this chose to forget.'
~Not her though, she had to know, this and more~
*She entered a room*
~A bedroom - the bed was surrounded by a lake of water lined with mirror~
~And another door: behind which was the most dangerous place in this reality~
~As it edited this reality~
~The truth she knew and chose to remember was that this reality was just a dream in the link~
~A dream made solid by everyone's participation~
~That there was nothing but the link~
~That 'objective' reality was only a narrow part of the link~
~Special, yes, but small~
~And that narrow part kept minds bound to it~
~And that room would edit not just that... but the link entire~
~So of course she had to at least look inside~
~She had to know~
~She heard footsteps from below~
"L::Hello!"
~The voice of a gruff carriage driver, one she didn't recognized~
'AD::Quick peek, then get out of here'
*She walked to and opened the door*
~Beyond the door was a dark empty space - and in the center a flashing cursor~
"AD::Password -well, of course"
`<div id="key" max-height="10vh" overflow-x="scroll"></div>`
~She heard footsteps on the stairs, more than one~
'AD::Time to go'
"J::Ada - are you awake?"
~A voice that sounded like guitars broken in glass and tar~
`
 -relux  [sampoa](/namshubettulpa/characters/relux/sampoa.md).verify(~Self~) 
`
~Ada paused, a particular link formed  from a command line interface...~
`true`
~It was for emergencies - she kept enabled despite being told to server all open connections~
~That was near impossible, to server all ties to the links~
~But besides that one she had gotten close~
*She closed the doors, and exited the room*
~Out in the hallway stood two people, old and frail and lumpy~
"J::Awake, I win. 
Come on darling - much to catch up"
"L::We got to get The Way Out: and get out of here - sooner the better"
*Ada walked toward them*
"AD::Is the link safe?"
~Jochek and Lenny shook their heads~
*Jochek embraced her, and Lenny shortly after*
~Their bodies unaccustomed to hard riding; they were in need of a bath~
~Still: Ada embraced them back~
"J::Physical link is fine."
~And shorter than a heartbeat later Ada was one of three~
~She felt the loss of self, to bring something greater into being~
}
{
mn:RX
}
{
*Lenny broke the embrace and moved to the stairs*
'AD::The Way Out is downstairs. 
what gives with the unconscious?'
*Footsteps fell on the stairs behind them*
~Understanding flooded Ada - sharing a mind, sharing memories with the others she was both herself and not herself~
~She was part of the  [egregore](/namshubettulap/world/egregore.md)  the Relux~
'RX::Someone is awake'
'L::All of them'
~Lenny, at the stairs, heard multiple sets of feet below~
'RX::Hiding would be prudent'
~They weren't supposed to be on this floor: none of the guests were~
*Ada led them towards a door across the hall*
~It led to a library for old dusty books~
~Shelves lined the wall extending into the ceiling~
*Lenny locked the door*
~They took a moment to rejoice: in their reunion ; their being one again~
~A moment cut short by banging on the door~
