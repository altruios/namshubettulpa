~13 people tied to chairs were kept under guard in an empty warehouse~
*One appendage strolled up to their leader*
~It wasn't something you could see, but though its husks Al-tok could sense it, the algera~
~He was sweating, blood dripping down the side of his face.
Soon to be another husk~
*Robert Glass pulled out the syringe*
*The captured leader struggled*
'AT::So much energy.'
~It would be a delight to have~
~Minutes passed, waiting for the serum to take effect, and then Al-tok stretched through his mind, controlling the algera~
~And then Al-tok felt it slipping away~
*From that singular point of a new husk, Algera started to leak*
'AT::NO...'
~Raw panic, then calmness: it wasn't rushing out... 
He could use this.
Before Al-tok was filled to the brim, and now, empty... 
Which let it follow the draining algera~ 
*The algera streamed in a thin vector through Al-tok, following some well of attraction*
~And leading him right to the sink hole~
'AT::The thorn!'
*Al-tok removed it from himself, inspecting it*

    }
}
`
~Al-tok was suspicious of its luck~
'AT::This is terribly convenient.'
~This was either a trap, or this Martha was born yesterday~
~Al-tok inspected it again, carefully, and found nothing hidden~
'AT::Thanks are in order.'
~It didn't need all the algera, not with this~
*Al-tok took the spear for himself*
~A direct connection to every human heart~

~The mirror prevented Rossin from joining Martha~
~She felt a pickling on her skin as she was transported, mentally at least, to a strange world~
'M::Not what I pictured.'
~She stood under blue skys on a cliff, a ledge of red clay extending miles either direction, bowing in on itself, completing a circle so large she shouldn't be able to see it~
~She could see the walls at the end though - despite the distance - as there was no ground in this circle save for one pillar in the center~
~A pillar host to a Giant vibrant green oak tree at the top, dominating the empty view~
~And in front of her, a singular rickety wooden bridge~ 
*it was swaying in a dusty breeze*
*She stepped onto it*
*In the distance a few planks came loose to a sudden gust*
'M::Okay, wait a second.'
~Martha could fly~
*She raised herself into the air*
'M::I need to get used to that...'
~The wind picked up and Martha thought for a moment the bridge was swept away, the landscape was otherwise featureless~
~No, it was the wind moving her: flying against it was fine, it was just erratic~
'M::Better than falling.'
*Martha flew out towards the edge and looked down*
~She saw a nothing, a familiar nothing at the bottom~
*She moved back over land*
~Her heart racing, she tried to calm her breathing~
'M::Why should you be worried, you can fly.'
~It was like an eye, and like an eye, it let no light escape. 
Instead deconstructed, absorbed and processed...
It Looked, and by doing so, destroyed in the process~
~So Martha resolved to fly over the bridge, using the side railings as a net~
'M::If there is no weight on it, nothing falls.'
*Martha flew over the bridge*
~She guessed it was a mile - but she couldn't get a read on distance~
~As time marched on, her sense of scale of the thing changed~
~No, it was closer to five away~
*She increased her speed greatly*
~What she mistook for a great oak tree in the distance grew into focus~
~The trunk were actually the roofs of houses stacked vertically, she could see movement between them, like pulsating veins~
~The tree WAS a city, or a city structured to look like a tree~
~It towered above Martha as she approached~
*Martha landed on the edge of the pillar, just where the bridge met earth*
~And Martha felt gravity shift, then herself falling towards the city-tree~
~She would have landed in a pool, had she not floated sideways away~
~She could still fly, but now she just had a new 'down', which was now toward the trunk of the tree~
~Below the canopy of roofs the streets were alive with activity in a false night~
~Humans, street vendors, littered the middle with carts selling glowing lanterns~
~Music was in the air, a faint choir hum in the along with...
Martha saw the source of the noise, a band with a satyr playing a pan flute, with a choir of Sirin behind them.
There was some sort of parade - marching down the wooden streets - streamers flying everywhere~
'M::What would be out of place here...'
*Martha looked around*
*The lights flashed red*
~The sudden cries of children filled the streets and parents rushed them into houses, any houses~
*Someone tugged at her, and Martha resisted*
~The vendors shut their doors and went inside the houses.
Soon everyone was in their homes and Martha was alone in the silence and flickering red lights~
~She heard a crashing in the distance~
'M::That does not sound good'
~Martha flew down the streets, searching for anything~
~paper confetti and colorful flags lay disregarded at her feet~
~What was she even looking for, she scanned the streets~
~she stopped, listening~
*Silence, and a faint distant...*
~Something... she chased it, and it grew into a metallic grinding, then a rhythmic thrumming~
'M::Music... is that punk rock?'
~Another crash in the distance~
*All the houses around her started to hum...
Then they started to glow*
~She heard the rumbling grow to a pitch of a thousand jet engines~
*Martha ducked into the center of the street*
~Hiding under a cart to try to escape the growing heat~
*The houses jettisoned away, flying off into the distant space*
~Walls of the chasm filled the sky, under the canopy she reoriented quickly~
~In front of her she saw the sky, open and blue~
~Behind her Martha saw the pillar was being swallowed into the void~
*An edge of the pillar broke away, and fell into the void*
~She watched it for a moment, but realized quickly she shouldn't wait to see how long it took to fall into that darkness~
~And around her was the deserted landscape of a urban suburbia with no buildings or people left, just placeholders, plots etched out in the sands of time~
*And punk rock playing to her right*
~She found it moments later, a record player, and wax disc~
*The ground shuddered, and another outside part of the pillar fell into the void*
~The part she entered from.
Taking the bridge with it~
'M::I can still fly.'
~She assured herself with a demonstration~
~The gravity was still shifted towards the now empty city-tree~
'M::First things first...'
*Martha took the record and spun it on her finger*
~She was mildly surprised it worked, a pattern shifted and undulated out from the record as it spun~
*She grabbed hold of the record player, put the the record in, and carried it with her as she flew away*
~It felt like flying up, gravity never shifted as she flew out over the void~
~It was much more manageable amount of panic looking at the void from the side than from below~
*Martha took a breath*
"M::You can do this."
*More of the pillar collapsed behind her*
~Pieces fell into the void, below her from this perspective~
~It looked like the cliff edge was drifting to her right~
~With horror, she realize she was sinking to her left~
*She looked back*
~The city-tree was sinking, being sucked sideways into the void from her point of view~
~Taking her with it, despite here flying away from it, it was still her ground~
~And regardless of how far she flew, gravity kept pulling just as strongly~
'M::Wait, gravity does not work like that.'
*Martha adjusted her trajectory*
~She was more than half way there but as the pillar sank lower: more of her velocity was fighting against being pulled in~
*She flew at full speed towards that cliff's edge*
~With the bridge posts, if she could just get there, she could use that as a anchor, a ledge to rest on~
~She was flying now just a bit faster than the pillar was falling, but that gap was rapidly closing~
*She reached the cliff edge, and wrapped herself around the bridge pole*
'M::Lets not do that again'
~Martha clung to that wooden post: fearing it would bend and fall in. 
The gravity slowly shift as the pillar tumbled into the depths below...
Slowly converged the farther the pillar fell. 
And soon she would be able to stand normally.
Though at a slight angle~
'M::Not going to be here that long, just need to find the exit.'
~Before that, though, Martha caught her breath, laying against the clay, wondering what had happened~
'M::Maybe it was the bridge: transition point broke.'
~She heard, then felt a rumble in the distance~
~The nothing below was growing~
*Fault lines cracked from the falling cliff face, rushing through the dry red clay, surrounding her*
*She jumped, then fell back down*
~The pillar was still falling, faster than she could fly~
~There was no obvious exit~
*She tried to run*
~And worse the gravity of the falling pillar made even standing up nearly impossible~
~Martha saw the earth riven at the cracks, she heard and felt the rumble, and her stomach dropped~
*The land mass she was on fell in, holding shape*
*She stood up*
~Martha was still under the effects the of faster falling pillar's gravity, which lessened with each passing moment of her decent~
*She looked up*
~Above her the walls of the circle soon filled the sky, winking out the sun, plunging her in darkness~
