~13 people tied to chairs were kept under guard in an empty warehouse~
*One appendage strolled up to their leader*
~It wasn't something you could see, but though its husks Al-tok could sense it, the algera~
~He was sweating, blood dripping down the side of his face~
~Soon to be another husk~
*Robert Glass pulled out the syringe*
*The captured leader struggled*
'AT::So much energy.'
~It would be a delight to have~
~Minutes passed, waiting for the serum to take effect, and then Al-tok stretched through his mind, controlling the algera~
~And then Al-tok felt it slipping away~
*From that singular point of a new husk, Algera started to leak*
'AT::NO...'
~Raw panic, then calmness: he could use this... 
Before Al-tok was filled to the brim, and now, empty... 
Which let it follow the draining algera~ 
*The algera streamed in a thin vector through Al-tok, following some well of attraction*
~And leading him right to the sink hole~
'AT::The thorn!'
*Al-tok removed it from himself, inspecting it*
`
spear{
    heart:Global.reduce((combined,*human*)=>
      combined+=*human*.*heart*
    ).filter(x=> x != ~Martha Crisp~)
    ~front~:{
        *radius*:~1in~
        ~spikes~:{
            ~style~:*Barbed*,
            *length*:~1ft~, 
            ~Location~:~Front corner at {2xπ(this.front.radius)}~}, 
        ~damage{+∞}~,
        ~piercing{+∞}~
    }
}
`
~Al-tok was suspicious of its luck~
'AT::This is terribly convenient'
~This was either a trap, or this Martha was born yesterday~
~Al-tok inspected it again, carefully, and found nothing hidden~
'AT::Thanks are in order.'
~It didn't need all the algera, not with this~
*Al-tok took the spear for himself*
~A direct connection to every human heart~
