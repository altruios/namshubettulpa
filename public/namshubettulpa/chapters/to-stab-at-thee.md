# to stab at thee

*Martha pushed Kent aside and ran to the kitchen*
"A::Get her!"
"K::What is going on?"
*Alacira and Gerald held out their left arm.
A bail rattled, glowing a white-blue*
"A::This is a warning, something's changed."
*Kent sat up and walked to the kitchen*
~The kitchen...~
'K::Duck!'
*Kent bent his knees*
~...was a long rectangular room.
A rolling island counter top was in the center.
The floor smooth, a black and white diamond checkered tiling.
Martha was at the end of the kitchen.
Her eyes wide and face impassive, she held a knife and a saw blade.
No.
She was holding one knife, her other hand was in mid throw.
A spinning knife was heading for him~
*The knife flew over his head, bouncing against the wall ricocheting towards him again.
He pushed out his coat, the hilt of the knife bounced off it and slid across the tiles*
"K::Circle around her!"
~Kent gave the order, He knew how to handle someone with a knife~
*Kent took off his coat and scrambled towards the other room*
'K::How many can she throw, Kent?'
"K::She has about..."
~Kent thought back to the kitchen block behind her...
that moment fresh in his mind~
"K::Five knives, three in the block behind her."
*Kent looked up*
"K::Hey, a little help?
Can you understand me?"
*The spiders bristled and chittered in reply.
They turned to each other, chittering*
~The net they constructed was more just a glob of spider glue. 
It was barely held together by wide swatches of non sticky webbing.
It was about half his size and he could pick it up with one hand, it was lighter than a baseball.
And they were done in seconds~
*Kent held the webbing in one hand, he held it out to his left and it caught a knife*
~He saw movement in the corner of his eye and Kent turned to face Martha poking out of the kitchen~
'K::Keep focus, four knives...'
*Kent pulled the knife out from the goo and tossed it against the wall*
~It stuck there, slowly sliding down, trailing like a snail~
*The doorbell rung*
"FL__F::I think that's the Relux..."
*Flanagan left to the front door*
~Sonny was below her spiders, she too received a net~
*Sonny and Wilbert ran through the foyer towards the kitchen's other entrance*
~Kent took a moment to collect himself...~
'K::She got possessed by this Al-tok thing, so they just have to exercise it, right?'
*Kent approached the kitchen holding out the net in front of him*
~A makeshift shield as well~
*Another knife landed in that makeshift net*
'K::Three...'
*He grabbed the knife and pulled*
~This one was stuck tight, but it eventually came free, the blade also trailing a slime residue~
~The island counter top was between Martha and Kent, Sonny and Wilbert were poking out the other threshold~
*Martha threw a knife in that direction, it landed in Wilbert's left side*
~Sonny had tried to block it with the same makeshift shield, but it only shielded how bad the wound was~
'K::Two.'
*Kent rushed towards Martha.
Martha spun towards him, and then away - pushing her back into his net, sending them both sprawling on the ground.
Martha's arm swang out to stab at Kent, but couldn't get the right angle*
~The blade coming dangerously close to his face.
The two struggled for a moment before Sonny dropped the net on Martha, sandwiching her between the two.
Martha's struggles were futile at that point~
*Alacira strolled into the kitchen*
~She looked over the situation.
Martha's arms had caught in the side of the net, rendering them useless~
"A::Right, now that's taken care of..."
*Kent and Sonny both gripped Martha's hands until they disarmed her*
"A::Let's get the doctor for Wilbert here."
"K::Which doctor will treat a fish-man?"
"G::Wrong determiner."
~Gerald was shouting from the parlor.
Kent saw that he held a clipboard, and was scribbling something furiously on it~
*Kent tilted his head*
"K::Wrong...
What?"
*Gerald waved him off*
"G::Not that one either.
Get Wilbert down the steps."
*Sonny and her spiders wrapped Wilbert in a hammock, and carried him out of the room*
~Beside him he watched Martha try to escape the webbing, no wasted energy on facial expressions...
Just lots of kicking and trashing~
~At the threshold stood a tall black man~
"L::And who might you be?"
*Lenny walked over held out his hand*
~It was almost an afterthought~
*Lenny leaned over Martha*
"L::She got this Al-tok thing in her?"
"A::No.
It's related, but it's not Al-Tok."
*Alacira raised her wrist*
~Kent saw the bail change color...
It lost it's color, and glow for a moment.
Then it winked back into existence~
"A::She's putting up a fight..."
~The bail's went still again, longer this time. 
And Kent noticed during these times Martha ceased struggling~

`todo:

martha encounters the creature in her head
    - she survives
    - it is wounded, but not integrated or defeated
        - code battle time!
    - she temporarily traps it in her past memories 
        - it can not pass the barrier of 'reset-2'
        - allows her to wake up to the physical world 
            - in a cardboard lab
            - strapped to table, almost injected

~Felix was reminiscing, days of lectures with Ozmind.
He remembered a time he was in the audience watching, a face among a small crowd of twenty.
Ozmind stood at the raised stage, with a chalkboard to his right~
*Ozmind slammed his pointer against the chalkboard*
~It made a sharp memorable ringing, reverberating along the flat wood paneling~
"O::...There are dangerous things one could do in such states."
~Felix tried, but couldn't remember the earlier parts of the lecture...
Not before that snap...~
"O::Identity is mutable, more so in these states...
Such alterations could be unintentionally permanent.
You may be unable, or unwilling to change back to your former self."
*A hand shot up near Felix, Ozmind pointed towards that hand*
~Ozmind recognized the scottish accent~
"E::Which states?"
"O::In the link..."
~Erin didn't lower her hand, and Ozmind eventually continued~
"O::Any state where you are not solidly in your self.
So the link is the biggest example: any others?"
~It was a question for the peanut gallery.
Felix heard a few timid voices behind him~
"S::Back of the mind?"
"O::Good, any part of the mind - any self reflecting state - not just the back."
~The rest of the memory faded into obscurity, and Felix focused on the present~
~He was still in his mind, with Flanagan at the helm.
Felix saw no one move, they were perfectly frozen in place.
Some part of the conversation was playing which Flanagan deemed inappropriate for him to witness.
In those moments reality seemed to pause from Felix's perspective... 
Followed by a sudden jump~
~With Flanagan able to hear his thoughts,
And with begging, pleading, groveling and sulking didn't work...~
*Suddenly Felix was in an elevator*
~Martha was restrained, and Kent was there wheeling the dolly Martha rested on~
'F::What the hell is happening?'
'FL::Oh, you are... right.
Timer will just... 
Okay - fixed...'
~And the world paused again. Frozen on a moment Felix wasn't supposed to see~
'F::Why?'
~There was no response. 
Wether Flanagan could hear him or was distracted, Felix did not know...
He hoped it was the latter~
'F::Hello?'
~Again, no response~
~Felix kept his thoughts from running too close to his plan.
Surprise could make all the difference.
It was taxing: trying not to think of something consciously, and only subconsciously think of a plan.
Like trying not to think of the first clich√© that comes to mind~
~So he didn't think of what he would become, just his desperation for escape~
*Felix became a parasite*
~In front of him was flanagan, piloting his body in the elevator, everything was still frozen~
*Felix thrust his hand into Flanagan's face*
~It melted in, little tendrils extended out from his skin, wiggling through capillaries into the arteries and searching for...
One of the tendrils found it, Algera~
*Felix began absorbing as much as he could*
~Felix fell into infinite infinities, stretching and breaking from his self, reforming wholistic larger.
At once he understood the cosmic joke and it broke him~
'F::Nothing?!'
~He couldn't believe it, and he bathed in that disbelief, twisting through the infinite~
*Everything jumped*
~They were in a cardboard room, Martha was strapped to a table.
Felix still had his hand in Flanagan's paling face~
"FL__F::What have you done?"
*Felix, in response, extended the tendrils deeper*
~They met no resistance, and soon, coated everything~
~In a moment Flanagan disappeared, and Felix's perspective lurched into where Flanagan had been~
~He could move his arms, his own arms, and felt nauseous from the sudden change in control~
~In the room he felt eyes turn on him, his sudden doubling over in heavy breathing a distinctly noticeable event~
"F::Excuse me..."
*Felix left the room, and in the hall started walking towards an exit*
'F::They want Flanagan, well, they are not getting him through me...'
~The Algera was warm in his mind, a burning fire at the base, brimming with power~
~The sudden freedom of thought, of not being monitored, was a relieve to Felix more than he realized.
The freedom to plan revenge~
