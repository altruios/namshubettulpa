~Felix was reminiscing, days of lectures with Ozmind.
He remembered a time he was in the audience watching, a face among a small crowd of twenty.
Ozmind stood at the raised stage, with a chalkboard to his right~
*Ozmind slammed his pointer against the chalkboard*
~It made a sharp memorable ringing, reverberating along the flat wood paneling~
"O::...There are dangerous things one could do in such states."
~Felix tried, but couldn't remember the earlier parts of the lecture...
Not before that snap...~
"O::Identity is mutable, more so in these states...
Such alterations could be unintentionally permanent.
You may be unable, or unwilling to change back to your former self."
*A hand shot up near Felix, Ozmind pointed towards that hand*
~Ozmind recognized the scottish accent~
"E::Which states?"
"O::In the link..."
~Erin didn't lower her hand, and Ozmind eventually continued~
"O::Any state where you are not solidly in your self.
So the link is the biggest example: any others?"
~It was a question for the peanut gallery.
Felix heard a few timid voices behind him~
"S::Back of the mind?"
"O::Good, any part of the mind - any self reflecting state - not just the back."
~The rest of the memory faded into obscurity, and Felix focused on the present~
~He was still in his mind, with Flanagan at the helm.
Felix saw no one move, they were perfectly frozen in place.
Some part of the conversation was playing which Flanagan deemed inappropriate for him to witness.
In those moments reality seemed to pause from Felix's perspective... 
Followed by a sudden jump~
~With Flanagan able to hear his thoughts,
And with begging, pleading, groveling and sulking didn't work...~
*Suddenly Felix was in an elevator*
~Martha was restrained, and Kent was there wheeling the dolly Martha rested on~
'F::What the hell is happening?'
'FL::Oh, you are... right.
Timer will just... 
Okay - fixed...'
~And the world paused again. Frozen on a moment Felix wasn't supposed to see~
'F::Why?'
~There was no response. 
Wether Flanagan could hear him or was distracted, Felix did not know...
He hoped it was the latter~
'F::Hello?'
~Again, no response~
~Felix kept his thoughts from running too close to his plan.
Surprise could make all the difference.
It was taxing: trying not to think of something consciously, and only subconsciously think of a plan.
Like trying not to think of the first clich√© that comes to mind~
~So he didn't think of what he would become, just his desperation for escape~
*Felix became a parasite*
~In front of him was flanagan, piloting his body in the elevator, everything was still frozen~
*Felix thrust his hand into Flanagan's face*
~It melted in, little tendrils extended out from his skin, wiggling through capillaries into the arteries and searching for...
One of the tendrils found it, Algera~
*Felix began absorbing as much as he could*
~Felix fell into infinite infinities, stretching and breaking from his self, reforming wholistic larger.
At once he understood the cosmic joke and it broke him~
'F::Nothing?!'
~He couldn't believe it, and he bathed in that disbelief, twisting through the infinite~
*Everything jumped*
~They were in a cardboard room, Martha was strapped to a table.
Felix still had his hand in Flanagan's paling face~
"FL__F::What have you done?"
*Felix, in response, extended the tendrils deeper*
~They met no resistance, and soon, coated everything~
~In a moment Flanagan disappeared, and Felix's perspective lurched into where Flanagan had been~
~He could move his arms, his own arms, and felt nauseous from the sudden change in control~
~In the room he felt eyes turn on him, his sudden doubling over in heavy breathing a distinctly noticeable event~
"F::Excuse me..."
*Felix left the room, and in the hall started walking towards an exit*
'F::They want Flanagan, well, they are not getting him through me...'
~The Algera was warm in his mind, a burning fire at the base, brimming with power~
~The sudden freedom of thought, of not being monitored, was a relieve to Felix more than he realized.
The freedom to plan revenge~
