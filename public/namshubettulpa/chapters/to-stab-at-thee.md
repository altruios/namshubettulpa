~Felix was reminiscing, days of lectures with Ozmind.
He remembered a time he was in the audience watching, a face among a small crowd of twenty.
Ozmind stood at the raised stage, with a chalkboard to his right~
*Ozmind slammed his pointer against the chalkboard*
~Making a sharp memorable ringing~
"O::...There are dangerous things one could do in such states."
~Felix tried, but couldn't remember the earlier parts of the lecture...
Not before that snap...~
"O::Where identity is mutable, such alterations could be unintentionally permanent.
You may be unable, or unwilling to change back to your former self."
*A hand shot up near Felix, Ozmind pointed towards that hand*
~Ozmind recognized the scottish accent~
"E::Which states?"
"O::In the link..."
~Erin didn't lower her hand, and Ozmind eventually continued~
"O::Any state where you are not solidly in your self.
So the link is the biggest example: any others?"
~It was a question for the peanut gallery.
Felix heard a few timid voices behind him~
"S::Back of the mind?"
"O::Good, any part of the mind - any self reflecting state - not just the back."

felix enacts his plan to regain his body
    x flash back: Felix sitting in a lecture
        x Ozmind is lecturing about the frailty of identity.
            x loose states are brought up.
                x loose states are states the mind can be in where identity is easier to change.  
                    x such as being in the back of the mind, or in the link.
    - need to access algera
        - from Flanagan
        - learns to become a parasite
        - with algera
            - learns of the way out 
            - access to enough algera to realize 'the conclusion' (is fiction)
            - hidden from audience what that conclusion is.
            - cracks a bit, understanding the nature of reality
                - focused on escape
    - tricks Flanagan
        - he convinces Flanagan to give him raised permissions, or access to the link. 
        - one of those is successful
