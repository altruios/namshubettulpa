todo: relux plot line

    ~Al-tok~ attacks ~the Relux~
      but being a hivemind: they stave it off.
    something happens to the way out, rendering it useless (figure that out)
    the three return to New York. (do they pick up dana?)

    ~Al-tok~ attacks ~Martha~ -
      ~Rossin~ sacrifices himself
        to prevent ~Al-tok~ from re-planting a seed.
    ~Martha~ has nightmares, 
      Is nearly taken over by ~Al-tok~ 
      instead joins ~The Relux~
