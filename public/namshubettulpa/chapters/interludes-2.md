mn:RG
~Robert was in pieces, parts scattered though the Link~
~Fragments of a thought, formed together~
~A sense of self emerged, senses emerged~
~His back~
'Is it my back? 
My physical representation of a back.'
~Was sticky~
*He was propelled throughout the link. Slamming into and congealing with himself*
~His sight returned~
~His eyes caught something darting around to is left~
*Twisting his head so he could see, he strained against the sticky back*
~Tentacles: as far as the eye could see~ 
~Dark pink lines in the blackness~
*Robert struggled in earnest* 
~Now realizing he was well and truly stuck~
'I am on a tongue.'
~The texture was a cat's tongue~
~He realized, that's what all those pink lines were~
~Tongues~
*Whipping back and forth*
~Like angry tornados~
*Something flashed across his face*
~He saw it flutter down below his feet~
'What was that?'
*He looked down*
~He wasn't in the link~
~Below him was the link~ 
~The connection between minds lay open before him~
*But the link was growing distant*
~This was a void~
*Robert was pulled away and he turned his head up*
~Above him was a creature of incomprehensible size~
~Stretching the bare horizon from end to end in eyes~
~The creature seemed to be growing, but no...~
*He was just getting closer*
'That will eat me.'
~His struggling was in vain as he was slowly raised up~
~Moments passed and Robert slowly came to rest~
*He looked back down*
~At the end of the tongue was a bulge, fading into white~
~He watched it gyrate~
~Robert turned his attention toward the creature above him~
~At it's ends, the creature was pustulating new eyes~
~As he grew closer he realized one eye was watching him~
'Well, this is a weird way to die.'
~And then he remembered~
'I am already dead...'
'So what is this?'
~There was a pause when he finally reached the creature's mouth~
~It was about the size of a house~
~Another smaller mouth pustuled out next to the eye~
"NULL::You've made your bargain: Why have you tried to make another."
*Robert blinked*
"RG::What?"
"NULL::You were mine, but you have poisoned yourself to me."
"RG::I was yours?"
"NULL::My food."
~Robert took two breaths to think~
"RG::Does that mean you aren't going to eat me?"
"NULL::I can not, to your detriment."
"RG::My detriment."
"NULL::If I do not eat you, something else will."
*Robert shrugged*
"RG::If I'm eaten I'm eaten, what's it matter by who."
"NULL::You do not understand. 
I eat only the surface - the uniqueness - not you.
This is mutually beneficial."
"RG::How? I'm dead aren't I."
"NULL::I receive the nutrients I need, and unfettered access to that food source.
In exchange I act as a recorder of lives sworn to feed me, collecting nutrients as you grow.
When I eat you, whats left behind is happy: at peace. for as long as humanity lives."
~Robert had doubts; was he actually out of the link~
~He tried to stretch his mind in a direction to follow down a path in the link~
~Nothing~
"NULL::I also shield against others. 
They have taken root elsewhere, but here... 
Here is mine."
~Robert said nothing~
*The creature pulled him closer*
"NULL::So shall you fix it."
~Robert struggled weakly against the tongue~
"RG::Why me?"
"NULL::I can not touch it, it is in you deep: which is why I have not eaten you."
"RG::And if I say no?"
"NULL::To the void with you."
'The void is a mystery...'
~He contemplated~
"RG::And if i say yes?"
*The tongue brought him up to the thing's eye*
"NULL::The infection spreads quickly.
Look."
~And he did~
~Through the whipping tongues he saw the link as he never had~
~From the outside~
~From a direction he could see all points in the link at once~
~Among the infinitely dimensional plane he saw a spot He identified as Al-tok~
~A dark growing withering fractal oil in the link~
"NULL::I saw how Alice made the serum. 
I understand it. 
It forced a human to have thoughts it couldn't otherwise have.
Thoughts that have invited... 
That."
~Robert knew the sound of perfect disgust then~ 
"NULL::You shall create a serum to force this intruder to remove itself from my food."
*Robert shook his head*
"RG::You want my sister, she was -"
"NULL::And we have her."
*A divide opened in the creature*
~A fleshy chasm, ending at the mouth attached to the tongue he was on~
*Robert was yanked across the creatures landscape*
~A forest of red-bubble-gum trees stretching into the sky~
~A sky: ideas and connections shown brightly~
~A dark moon growing~
~Mountains that were the creatures flesh came and went in a flash~
*Suddenly they stopped, at a reeling tongue*
~At the end, being pulled toward him, was his sister~
"AG::Robert?"
~He tried to wave~
*His arm just jerked on the tongue*
"RG::Hello..."
"NULL::You will construct a serum of my design."
~The mouth commanded~
"AG::I will?"
~She sounded incredulous~
"NULL::One of you. 
If not you: him, having what he needs from you."
*She struggled against the tongue*
"AG::Why should I help you."
"NULL::It is your fault: your responsibility."
~She smiled at that, looking at Robert~
"AG::When have I ever taken responsibility."
~The eye scowled at her~
"NULL::Your antics will not be tolerated."
*The two tongues slammed together*
~Robert and Alice felt the impact into each other~
~When the tongues parted there was only one~
'AG__RG::What happened?'
~That wasn't his thought, the voice was wrong~
"RG::Alice?" 
'AG__RG::Robert?'
"NULL::You have everything you require."
"RG::You just put her in me?"
"NULL::You will be given the formula and process to synthesis."
~A boil exploded next to the eye: a spray of pus rushed toward him~
~It congealed forming into a tentacle that whipped into his eye~
"NULL::See it!"
~Robert screamed~
~Part of his mind was being overwritten~
~Old memories drugged from the depths to fodder the process~
"NULL::Go forth and sterilize!"
*The tongues shot toward the link again*
~Beside him the mouth reformed on the tongues~
"NULL::I can do nothing once inside, I will place you where it can not find you. 
You will require a physical body."
'RG::Should I even be helping this thing.'
~It was his own thoughts, echoing his sister's~
'It had promised to eat me after all, if I removed that thing...'
'AG__RG::Wait, it was going to eat us?!'
'No...'
~Robert thought at her in mock astoundment~
'RG::A giant creature with a billion tongues...'
~He continued while they fell~
'RG::Has no intention of eating you.'
~Alice's mind - like every mind - was a turmoil of stochastic half thoughts~
~Robert waited for her to properly think at him, though he was helpless not to know her mind inside his~
'AG__RG::Seriously, should we be helping this.'
'RG::Look.'
~They looked at the link~
~At the growing fractal moon snuffing out parts of the link~
'RG::We can deal with this creature after that, if we decide we want to.'
'AG__RG::Do you?'
'RG::Do I what?'
'AG__RG::Want to still get out.'
'RG::We are out.'
~Robert felt a turning in his head: a refutation from Alice~
'AG__RG::You: look.'
~Robert felt his attention turn to the tongues~
~They were everywhere: touching nearly everyone and everything~
'AG__RG::We are cattle to it, maybe we poison the herd.'
~Robert considered~
"NULL::We are approaching; I would not appreciate finding another species to eat."
~Robert felt the barrier to the link as a thin soap bubble~
~Quite enveloped him, as he fell at the edge of all things~
~Towards a ship~

~Gerald was alone on sub-deck three starboard, clipboard in hand. 
He was carefully watching the shield hold back the storm~
*He gripped the metal railing*
~All that was keeping him from the void was that thin iron~
~The rippling colors on the shield were concerning Gerald~
'G::We are going to need more adventurers...'
~The end's dreadnought had energy requirements.
It needed dreams.
So Alacira and Whitewater gave them to it~
*He made a mark, then wrote some numbers*
~How many new people they would bring on, and some rough calculations~
'G::Eleven...'
~At most that many, but that was only for the shield.
He had the rest of the list he was holding to inspect yet~
'G::Onward ho...'
~It was time to inspect the generators, then the steering, then the -~
~He felt the floorboards vibrate first, the thud came second~
*Gerald spun around*
~A person was there, on deck. 
Gerald had just turned away from the only door out of this observation deck.
So this man came from out there~
*Gerald backed away*
'G::Alarm, raise the alarm.'
~There was an intruder on board~
~Gerald noticed the the tugging on his wrist~
*A small turquoise bail rattled and glowed, its gravity turned toward the intruder*
'G::Is it a piece of, or is it...'
~Gerald couldn't finish the though~
*He ran out of the observation deck and closed the door behind him.
The metal door closed with a thud, spinning locked behind him*
~Above and to his right, he saw the red button~
*He pressed it an alarms blared*
'G::You have the radio...'
*He grabbed the radio from his belt and click it on*
"G::Captain, copy?"
~Tense moments passed and he heard some banging on the door behind him~
"A::What's going on, gerald?"
*Gerald backed away from the door*
"G::You got your white whale here in sub-deck three, I think..."
~Gerald waited, the door was locked, it would -~
*A small red dot appeared in the metal, it grew brighter shifting in color to a bright white. then it slowly started moving*
"A::Locking decks below you, evacuate to the top."
*Gerald started running in earnest*
"G::Copy, it's getting in..."
~Gerald stole a glance back, watching where the dot of blinding heat had reached. 
It was making an arc, but it was not far along~
"G::Estimated fifty seconds until it breaches."
~The stairs up would be to the right, down the hall, he could make it~
"A::Get up here and -"
~Gerald didn't hear the rest, behind him was an explosion~
*Boom*

~Gerald woke up some time later, when Wilbert was fishing him out of the rubble~
"W::I've got one over here."
*Alacira came rushing over*
"A::Run faster next time, do you need anything?"
~Gerald waved her off~
"G::Is it still here?"
"A::No. 
We thought it took you as well,
Now we're only missing one..."
~Just one...
It could have been worse, Gerald rationalized.
Still, he was glad we wasn't that one~
*Gerald heard a rumbling above him*
~Not from the ship, but from the shield~
"G::Who's missing."
"A::One of the dreamers."
~Gerald updated the list in his head~
'G::twelve needed now...
Or as low as ten children.' 
~Children on averaged attract more algera on their dreams~
*Gerald got up*
~Slowly, testing each limb first~
"A::What was the color?"
*Gerald grabbed his wrist*
~The one with the small banded leather bracelet~
"G::Turquoise, more blue than green."
*Alacira nodded*
"A::Our white whale is pure blue, so it was a piece...
Or less..."
~Gerald surveyed the damage.
Most of the deck was fine save for one door, leading to a dreamer's room~
*Gerald looked inside, staying at the threshold*
~The room was a mess, items scattered everywhere. 
There was no bed, no one wanted to sleep while dreaming~
'G::Oh dear, is that blood?'
~On the floor was a stain~
"A::Let's get our dreamer back."
*Gerald leaned out of the room, facing Alacira*
"G::We'll need a few more, I was in the middle of my rounds..."
*Gerald handed the clipboard to Wilbert, who nodded and walked off*
"G::Right then, shall we?"

~The dreary hospital Robert and Alice woke from was understaffed.~
'AG__RG::So we know none of their locations?'
~Robert was in control, piloting the body of the coma patient: a young child of seven~
"RG__HP::Besides ozmind, and he can't be counted on."
*A nurse walked in*
"N::My you're awake!"
~They tried and failed to speak, their brain just not developed enough.
Alice was immediately concerned.
If they needed to use a phone: that meant their brain couldn't support...~
"RG__HP::Do you have my cellphone?"
*The nurse perused the closet in front of them, then handed them a cellphone*
~A short look into memories for a password.
Robert was downloading the translator...~
*Robert piloted the patient to hold up the phone*
`
hooks.wipe{~memories~}.find(x=>x==~self~)
`
~The nurse's eye twitched, and they held a blank stare~
*The nurse walked back out of the room*
*Robert searched the closets in front of them, for clothes*
~A short time later, they were on the road.
Driving a classic cadillac down a lonely desert highway.
They left old man they took it from with nothing~
"RG__HP::We're on an island, in here, this coma patient."
'AG__RG::As much as an island as you can get, I suppose.
There is still the physical link...'
~The were heading to an international airport, with only a few miles to go~
"RG__HP::We stay here, we don't go though the link."
~Alice didn't have to hear Robert's explanation to know his thoughts.
Al-tok was in the link;
Stay out of shark infested waters while bleeding~
'AG__RG::We need an older body, fully formed brain.'
~Robert, she could tell, was already on it, he had a subject in mind...
Or if not that specific subject...
A place in mind to find a suitable subject~
'AG__RG::I should have set up a landing pad.'
"RG__HP::Or just don't die..."
~A break, where they dove under the desert sun, undisturbed.
After reaching the airport they stood staring at the terminals for a time~
'AG__RG::We will need a lab.'
~Robert had the information as well, stored somewhere that creature put it~
'RG__HP::We have a few options, there is that chemist in New York?'
~Alice dismissively rejected that~
'RG__HP::Dubai it is.'
*Robert piloted them towards the terminal*
'AG__RG::We will also need a subject.'
"RG__HP::So we head back to New York."
'AG__RG::No, Not anywhere near that thing until we are ready, but...
As long as al-tok here, that thing is not going to eat us.'
~That thing with the billion eyes, and tongues.
An image so vast it took time to process~
~The argument continued into seating on the plane.
They were in first class, of course~
"RG__HP::So what?
We use it as a bargaining chip?
Make them fight each other?
What?"
'AG__RG::The bargaining chip is a good idea...'
~They contemplated and fought as the plane took off for Dubai~
