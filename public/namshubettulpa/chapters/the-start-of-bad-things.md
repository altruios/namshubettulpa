# THE START OF BAD THINGS

{
mn:F
'F::If you have near unlimited power, what do you do with your spare time? 
Do you feed the hungry, house the homeless? 
power is limited, no matter how vast, and:'
`(~The power to shape wills is an ocean in one mind~ || ~A bucket in everyone's~)=> 
~Power gained by others, neuters power for everyone else~ && (
~Washing every direction such that nothing gets done~ 
	: 
~Not sharing that power if you obtain it~
)
`
~Felix felt the loss as awareness flooded someone else, it was happening more and more~
~Each loss seemed more noticeable~
~More and more with each newly awakened human, did his power grow less effective, less pure~
'F::Why does it feel like a big chunk...'
~His memory turbulent in a way in which even the awakened were unaware~
~He always remembered being this powerful~
~He also had the vague notion of a large group of peers~
~But he knew that was wrong~
~Even if he disconnected himself mostly from the link - he couldn't be completely separated~
~All he could do was stay at a distance and put up and much of a barrier as he could~
~But still: he felt ripples~
~Ripples of others mismatching a wave: distorting it, cancelling it~
~Never again reaching such heights, but falling into a sea of mediocrity~
}
{
~This would progress until his ability to influence people would stretch so thin as to be invisible~
~Until the people practiced namshubs "in theory", the more people asleep the more powerful the awake~
~He wondered when he would get the text~
'F::A week from now?'
~Most people who accidentally stumbled into reality got reprogrammed or quickly removed~
'F::It took a special resilient sort, before anyone on the council would acknowledge their sentience.'
}
{
~It was noon, and he was on a yacht in the caribbean sea~
~He had just picked up the two servants from an island where they had been celebrating their honeymoon~
~No prior servant experience required with the right namshub~
'F::Catch and release.'
~He kept to that rule at least~
'F::Do not hurt them, do not ruin their lives, return them where you found them.'
~He would at least be considerate in that regard, considering he was overwriting them~
~He tried at least to leave them as 'better people'~
~It was a warm summer day, and  nothing to look forward to but for the cool breeze and a margarita in his hand~
~And his thoughts drifted ideally~
~Webs of gossip in his mind were unfolding to gossamer tendrils of conspiracy~
~He wasn't near the top of the hierarchy - but with a few adjustments - he could be~
'F::He could consolidate power and... 
Then what?  
Dole it out all day to particular people.'
~Not only would that be exhausting, Felix really didn't know what he wanted done other than his own satisfaction~
'F::Better to not rock the boat.'
'Scheme just enough to maintain the status quo.'
`req=>{send(statusQuo=>~Self~.statusQuo)};`
~If he had been moving, or preoccupied, he wouldn't have noticed the request~
~Basic info was automatic - and didn't require any conscious thought~
~His info was out of date, he hadn't looked in the link in more than a week~
'F::A personal best.'
~He was about to request the sender information when his phone vibrated once, indicating a text~
}
{
'F::That was fast.'
*Picking up the phone he opened the text of jumbled letters and contained a picture with markings on it*
*Taking a notepad out of his pocket he turned to a particular page and checked his watch*
'F::12:30 meant line 25' 
~He confirmed the jumbled letters in the text matched the ones in the notepad~
*When they did: he placed the phone by his eye and his vision was consumed by  a pattern of white and black*
~Taking in a new thought, thoughts not in your language can be taxing~
~Really strange thoughts, thoughts with power and shape can be incredibly taxing~
~But it's like a muscle - the more you do it, the stronger you get~
~So he practiced~
~Every single day after his training, until he could stomach it~ 
*but still - he fainted*
~It wasn't for long, just for an instant~
~The more experienced one's, the one's doing this for hundreds of years, didn't even black out~
~It's been 4 years since he 'woke up'~ 
~and he, like everyone who woke up so soon: still blacked out~
~Yet he was the only one who didn't fall and convulse on the floor~
~All the info was in his head, the location, details~
~Most of her life condensed down into a pattern in his brain he could unfold, examine, and plan~
~And there was a notice~
~She was to be induced as awakened~
'F::Not unheard of'
~Felix let the information unfurl further~
'F::Usually a few chains of strings to get inducted...'
~Into a society they were supposed to know nothing about by design~
~Rich families nepotism and passing on the benefits of knowledge to their youth, that's one example~
~But in this case: Felix couldn't see the reason for her induction~
~She was a pleb, a clerk at a grocery market~ 
~No particular traits to note either~
}
{
"F::Grab us some booze from below, make it fancy."
*The servants obeyed* 
"F::And you - go take us in to the harbor, get a car - take us to the airport."
~Soon to take a jet to America, to deal with his one job~
~He watched as the servants departed~
~He picked them mostly for their physicality, to satisfy his plans later, which would be put on hold~
~And others would be found instead~
'Work before pleasure.'
*He put his sunglasses on before taking another sip of his margarita in the sun*
~He continued his musings, most of the Erase-ees he helped execute were deemed to be for the greater good~
~'This person was awake and tampering with people in a way we don't agree with' was the general reason~
~Which agreed with him for the most part~
~For the most part they had been a sort of evil willing to spread harm though others~
~While those in power mostly sought power for its own sake over promoting any particular evil~
~So Felix erased them until they hadn't woken, leaving them harmless and free to live out their proletariat lives~
~Some people may have been inducted early... really early... but if their crimes were bad enough~
}
{
'F::It was hard to police a society of...'
~He wanted to say gods, but that sounded too arrogant~
~Awakened was always too nebulous for him to take seriously~
~But regardless, it was hard to police beings that could warp other's realities~
~Perhaps his reality on the boat was a delusion, but that thought always came up when he thought of such things~
'F::Do not doubt your own reality if you want to affect others'
~Words from the first year of training he had~
~It was 3 years of grueling training, mentally and physically in New York, and another 5 up over in Bucharest~
~And this had been the lax institutions~
~One other existed in London, known for being unforgiving to it's recruits~
~Felix was thankful he started off in New York~
}
{
`['Should I mentor her?']`
~The thought jumped out, a shooting star above the others~
~He quite liked the idea of taking someone under his wing~
~Showing them the importance of all they do~
~Giving them the guidance he had to struggle for when he was learning~
~It would be some bit of work, but what else was he to do with his time~
'F::Laze about...'
~Well, He could do that~
'F::Or he could mold a pawn...'
'F::Stop it Felix, you are doing it again, just mentoring, that should not be a problem.'
*The servants arrived with the booze*
"F::Share with me."
~It was practical, felix notice his generosity always seemed to have a practical purpose~
~Testing for poison from someone who might have temporarily slipped his grasp~
'F::Not going to make that mistake again.'
~He watched them drink~
~He watched the sunset behind the sun, and the boat enter the harbor~
~He took his first sip in the rental car, sure it was safe~
'F::If there is no flight to this Martha, I would have to make one.'
*Felix groaned and sipped his wine*
'F::So much work, this Martha better be worth it.'
"F::You, check up on flights for me, going to the Americas."
*The passenger in the front seat complied*
