     Narrator:"Martha"
    ~Martha receives a phone call - it's al-tok in the body of family~
    ~Al-tok~'s access to any human heart means it can take over for a short time.
      - this is a death sentence

  Narrator:"Felix"
    ~Felix~ is seething in the back seat of his mind
        - is prevented from hearing parts of the conversation
        - finds away around this while watching the following:
    ~Alacira~ and ~Flanagan~ 'nuke'(firebomb) the lab - destroying the physical presence of ~Al-Tok~.
        - which does not remove al-tok from the link, but without a physical body, Al-tok can't directly run namshubs.
        
        
    Narrator:"Al-tok" - Al-tok now only physically exists in the people temporarily taken over.
        - with no access to the serum he does not have the time to make it in a single body.
        - Al-tok has to body hop (be in at least one body) before the death of the host, otherwise it will loose permissions.
            - Al-tok doesn't want to burn through its stock too quickly.

    Narrator:"Kent"
        ~Kent~ holds his badge, contemplates what he's now involved with
        ~The navigator~ and ~Kent~ rejoin

        ~Robert/Alice~ in the body of ~Alacira's lost shipmate~ (
            write this in somewhere in dream chapters.
        ) ~ enters and informs them why they messed up in the second interludes
