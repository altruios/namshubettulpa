~Martha's vision burned, the pain was in her skin, all around her.
It was the same pain that happened when Rossin and her switched places, only turned up to 11~
~She had her eyes closed but everything was white, she couldn't hear anything. 
The pain subsided, and she felt her voice horse~
'M::Was I screaming?'
~She opened her eyes, the pain was lowering but everything was still white.
Slowly things came into focus.
She was in Flanagan's foyer, holding the mirror: squeezing it~
"K::Martha?"
~Kent was standing over her, behind him was Flanagan~
"FL__F::It's one thing to push her in from a dream..."
"A::Are you back yet?"
~Martha's head was still clearing, waking from a dream~
*She sat up*
"M::Al-tok has the spear."
"A::Did you get it?"
"K::Spear?"
"FL__F::The one that...?"
"A::Did you find it, Martha?"
"M::That one."
"A::Martha!"
"M::Yes, I got it."
"A::Good. 
Not having a ship is really inconvenient.
Just keep it safe for now."
"FL__F::We have bigger worries.
Al-tok has a direct connection to every human heart.
Martha, what happened?"
'R::We happened, I...
I wanted to change the system, I wanted you to.
In so doing we built the tool of our destruction.'
~Martha explained the dream~
"FL__F::This isn't the worse.
It still needs Alice's serum to exist in a host.
It wants to consume, not just kill us."
"K::So you're saying it's not going to kill everyone on the planet in one go?"
"FL__F::I don't know."
*The phone rang*
*Flanagan tilted his head, but walked behind the desk and pulled out a small device*
~It had two round holes and a grey display in front~
*Flanagan picked up the phone and placed it in this device*
~A short while later words appeared~
~'Is Martha there?'~
*Flanagan held a finger to his mouth*
'R::Is that Al-Tok?'
~'An echo, she is.
Come outside: so you - '~
*The machine clicked and Flanagan placed the phone back in its cradle*
'FL__F::If that was - '
*The phone rang again, and Flanagan placed it back into the device*
~'Come outside: so you can be free.
I want to thank you.'~
"FL__F::We'll stay here."
~'I'll come to you.'~
*The machine clicked*
"M::He doesn't know where we are, does he?"
"FL__F::It called here. It, not he."
~Flanagan hesitated~
"FL__F::We need to know more."
*Flanagan pressed some buttons on the device and the phone started ringing*
~There was no answer~
"FL__F::Calling number.
lets see..."
~Flanagan read off some numbers~
'M::Oh shit.'
~She recognized that number.
It was her Mother's~

~Felix could feel the lock on his mind. 
Bits of the conversation Flanagan and the other's had slipped from his memory~
~They were talking - discussing a plan - sitting around a coffee table.
Flanagan at the head, standing.~
~Try as he might, Felix couldn't move, nor could he reach Flanagan's mind.
He saw a ghostly version of the world, locked in a relative position behind his own body.
With Flanagan at the helm~
"FL__F::Your Mother?"
~Felix saw Martha nod~
*The phone rang again, and Flanagan placed it in the device once again*
~Felix couldn't read the words on the device~
"FL__F::They wouldn't have called if they weren't sure.
Lana, what did you have?"
"A::Meta-metastatic over-writing."
'FL::Well that would kill her for sure.'
'F::Who?'
'FL::Martha.'
*Flanagan coughed*
"FL__F::Well, that would work.
Rather high cost."
"A::Do you have anything better?"
*Flanagan sighed*
~He did not~
'F::But do I?'
'FL::Do you what?'
~Flanagan could hear his direct thoughts, but just the surface level~
~Felix kept still and let his mind glaze over, a plan starting to form.
It would save Martha, free him, and give him leverage.
He had no leverage right now, and look where that gotten him.
He was stuck watching his own body~
~He noticed he missed a large portion of that conversation~
*Flanagan put down the phone*
"K::You were speaking metaphorically, yeah?"
"FL__F::Yes, of course, we're actually just firebombing a city block: not nuking the city."

~Most of Al-tok was working in the lab. 
Now that he could reach anyone, well, why would it waste resources on public interfaces.
He could just take a host, and walk them back to the lab for a permanent upgrade~
~Al-tok was still incomplete. 
More hosts let it fit more of itself in this reality.
but they were pitifully small pools for his essence~
*The husks moved about in a hive of activity, then all stopped and looked up to a whistling sound in the distance
They shuddered in pleasure the the screeching wind breaking apart to form that whistle*
~Then they were gone, in an instant Al-tok reeling~
~The New Yorker it inhabited did not have the serum yet, Al-tok was just about to walk him over... 
But now...
Now he was in only one~
~He still had the spear, and as he felt this host give out, he spread to the next one... 
If he lost all his hosts...~
'AT::There is still the link.'
~But he wouldn't have the same raised privileges that having a body gave, he wouldn't be able to spread~
*Al-tok was in the mind of a child and mother in a shopping mall*
~It timed how long they lasted, only a few minutes~
*Al-tok, in the body of a teenager in the middle of a skating flip, roared, then tumbled*
~The serum took days to make, was a delicate process that took several people working on it~
'AT::So just...'
~Al-tok was in the host of a young girl drawing at a desk~
*It furiously started drawing*
~When the host died, Al-tok took another, taking the picture to the living room and continuing the drawing.
Then the neighbor... 
Neighbors...
Really it was finding the right colors: no one seemed to have colored pencils~
'AT::There...'
*Al-tok, over a pile of bodies in a suburban kitchen, took a picture of that image on a phone*
~Al-tok searched through the hearts, filtering~
`
const serum_producers = *spear*.heart.filter(h=>Globals.humans.filter({role:~Scientist~}).find(x=>x.heart==h)) 
const numbers = serum_producers.map(x=>x.~phone number~) 
`
*Al-tok sent that image to a list of phone numbers*
~It took several bodies, it was a long list of numbers~
~Now all it had to do was wait~

todo:
     Narrator:"Martha"
    ~Martha receives a phone call - it's al-tok in the body of family~
    ~Al-tok~'s access to any human heart means it can take over for a short time.
      - this is a death sentence

  Narrator:"Felix"
    ~Felix~ is seething in the back seat of his mind
        - is prevented from hearing parts of the conversation
        - finds away around this while watching the following:
    ~Alacira~ and ~Flanagan~ 'nuke'(firebomb) the lab - destroying the physical presence of ~Al-Tok~.
        - which does not remove al-tok from the link, but without a physical body, Al-tok can't directly run namshubs.
        
        
    Narrator:"Al-tok" - Al-tok now only physically exists in the people temporarily taken over.
        - with no access to the serum he does not have the time to make it in a single body.
        - Al-tok has to body hop (be in at least one body) before the death of the host, otherwise it will loose permissions.
            - Al-tok doesn't want to burn through its stock too quickly.

    Narrator:"Kent"
        ~Kent~ holds his badge, contemplates what he's now involved with
        ~The navigator~ and ~Kent~ rejoin

        ~Robert/Alice~ in the body of ~Alacira's lost shipmate~ (
            write this in somewhere in dream chapters.
        ) ~ enters and informs them why they messed up in the second interludes
