# desperate resort

~Martha's vision burned, the pain was in her skin, all around her.
It was the same pain that happened when Rossin and her switched places, only turned up to 11~
~She had her eyes closed but everything was white, she couldn't hear anything. 
The pain subsided, and she felt her voice horse~
'M::Was I screaming?'
~She opened her eyes, the pain was lowering but everything was still white.
Slowly things came into focus.
She was in Flanagan's foyer, holding the mirror: squeezing it~
~Rossin stood at her side~
"K::Martha?"
~Kent was next to Rossin, behind him was Flanagan~
*Flanagan walked forward and through Rossin*
"FL__F::It's one thing to push her in from a dream..."
"A::Are you back yet?"
~Martha's head was still clearing, waking from a dream~
*She sat up*
"M::Al-tok has the spear."
*Gerald and Wilbert shot glances at each other*
"A::Did you get it?"
"K::Spear?"
*Sonny tilted her head quizzically*
"FL__F::The one that...?"
"A::Did you find it, Martha?"
"M::That one."
~Alacira was nearly shouting~
"A::Martha!"
"M::Yes, I got it."
"A::Good. 
Not having a ship is really inconvenient.
Just keep it safe for now."
*Flanagan waved for her to sit down*
"FL__F::We have bigger worries.
Al-tok has a direct connection to every human heart.
Martha, what happened?"
'R::We happened, I...'
*Rossin smiled weakly*
'R::I wanted to change the system, I wanted you to.
In so doing we built the tool of our destruction.'
~Martha explained the dream~
"FL__F::This isn't the worse.
It still needs Alice's serum to exist in a host.
It wants to consume, not just kill us."
"K::So you're saying it's not going to kill everyone on the planet in one go?"
~Flanagan didn't answer at first~
"FL__F::I don't know."
*The phone rang*
*Flanagan tilted his head, but walked behind the desk and pulled out a small device*
~It had two round holes and a grey display in front~
*Flanagan picked up the phone and placed it in this device*
~A short while later words appeared~
~'Is Martha there?'~
*Flanagan held a finger to his mouth*
'R::Is that Al-Tok?'
~'An echo, she is.
Come outside: so you - '~
*The machine clicked and Flanagan placed the phone back in its cradle*
'FL__F::If that was - '
*The phone rang again, and Flanagan placed it back into the device*
~'Come outside: so you can be free.
I want to thank you.'~
"FL__F::We'll stay here."
~'I'll come to you.'~
*The machine clicked*
"M::He doesn't know where we are, does he?"
"FL__F::It called here. It, not he."
~Flanagan hesitated~
"FL__F::We need to know more."
*Flanagan pressed some buttons on the device and the phone started ringing*
~There was no answer~
"FL__F::Calling number.
lets see..."
~Flanagan read off some numbers~
'M::Oh shit.'
~She recognized that number.
It was her Mother's~
*The phone rang again*

~Felix could feel the lock on his mind. 
Bits of the conversation Flanagan and the other's had slipped from his memory~
~They were talking - discussing a plan - sitting around a coffee table.
Flanagan at the head, standing.~
~Try as he might, Felix couldn't move, nor could he reach Flanagan's mind.
He saw a ghostly version of the world, locked in a relative position behind his own body.
With Flanagan at the helm~
"FL__F::Your Mother?"
~Felix saw Martha nod~
*The phone rang again, and Flanagan placed it in the device once again*
~Felix couldn't read the words on the device~
~Everything froze in place, Felix could think, but something was wrong...
This happened occasionally, parts of their conversation he couldn't hear, so from his perspective: everything froze~
'F::Something Flanagan did...'
~Felix struggled, but still: could not move~
~Everyone in the room jumped into place~
*Flanagan put the phone back in its cradle*
"FL__F::They wouldn't have called unless they were sure.
Lana, what did you have?"
"A::Meta-metastatic over-writing."
'FL::Well that would kill her for sure.'
'F::Who?'
'FL::Martha.'
*Flanagan coughed*
"FL__F::Well, that would work.
Rather high cost."
"A::Do you have anything better?"
*Flanagan sighed*
~Felix could tell Flanagan did not~
'F::But do I?'
'FL::Do you what?'
"FL__F::Al-tok can't have a physical body for that to work..."
~Flanagan could hear his direct thoughts, but just the surface level~
~Felix kept still and let his mind glaze over, a plan starting to form.
It would save Martha, free him, and give him leverage.
He had no leverage right now, and look where that gotten him.
He was stuck watching his own body~
~Around him everyone had been frozen.~
'F::But for how lo-'
~Everyone jumped into place again~
"C::...4 ave, New York."
~He noticed he missed a large portion of the conversation.
Martha was crying, and Kent...
Kent was holding his badge~
*Flanagan had the phone in his hand*
"FL__F::Center the last one around this address:"
~Felix felt a Flanagan filter through his memories, until one stood out. 
It was where he had killed Alice~
*Flanagan put down the phone*
"K::You were speaking metaphorically, yeah?"
~Kent's voice was tight~
"FL__F::Yes, of course, we're actually just firebombing a city block or two: not nuking the city."
'F::What were you talking about before?'
'FL::Something that does not concern you.'
~Felix watched, trying, and again failing to move~
'F::Get another host!'
"K::I'm sorry, you did what?"
'FL::I rather like this one. 
You can have it back when we are done.'
"FL__F::We just sent a cruise missile to Alice's lab, and the undernet headquarters."

~Most of Al-tok was working in the lab. 
Now that he could reach anyone, well, why would it waste resources on public interfaces.
It could just take a host, and walk them back to the lab for a permanent upgrade~
~Al-tok was still incomplete. 
More hosts let it fit more of itself in this reality.
but they were pitifully small pools for its essence~
*The husks moved about in a hive of activity, then all stopped and looked up to a whistling sound in the distance
They shuddered in pleasure the the screeching wind breaking apart to form that whistle*
~Then they were gone, in an instant Al-tok reeling~
~The New Yorker it inhabited did not have the serum yet, Al-tok was just about to walk him over... 
But now...
Now Al-tok was in only one~
~Al-tok still had the spear, and as it felt this host's heart give out~ 
*Al-tok spread to the next one*
~If it had no hosts...~
'AT::There is still the link.'
~But Al-tok wouldn't have the same raised privileges that having a body gave. 
Privileges like being able to use objects: like that spear...
It wouldn't be able to spread how it wanted~
*Al-tok was in the mind of a child and mother in a shopping mall*
~It timed how long they lasted, only a few minutes~
*Al-tok, in the body of a teenager in the middle of a skating flip, roared, then tumbled*
~The serum took days to make, was a delicate process, and took several people working on different parts of it at the same time~
'AT::There is not enough time...'
~Everything Al-tok touched burned without that serum~
'AT::So just...'
~Al-tok was in the host of a young girl drawing at a desk~
*It furiously started drawing*
~When the host died, Al-tok took another, taking the picture to the living room and continuing the drawing.
Then the neighbor... 
Neighbors...~
~The Neighbors, the curious ones, drew closer; they wondered why people were dashing into this particular house.
Less distance for the hosts, Al-tok didn't mind, more time for drawing~
*Al-tok moved the drawing to the kitchen table*
~So the next host would have more time to draw.
It wouldn't have to climb over the bodies piling the room.
But that wasn't the biggest difficulty...
Really it was finding the right colors: no one seemed to have colored pencils~
'AT::There...'
*Al-tok, over a pile of bodies in a suburban kitchen, took a picture of that image on a phone*
~Al-tok searched through the hearts, filtering~
`
const serum_producers = *spear*.heart.filter(h=>Globals.humans.filter({role:~Scientist~}).find(x=>x.heart==h)) 
const numbers = serum_producers.map(x=>x.~phone number~) 
`
*Al-tok sent that image to a list of phone numbers*
~It took several bodies, it was a long list of numbers~
~Now all it had to do was wait~
'AT::burn through them slowly.'
~It could take them all, but then what?
A few moments was not enough~
~So it waited~
~Moments before the host died, Al-tok noticed the curiously normal behavior of the neighbors~
*Al-tok took the next host outside the house*
~It was an old lady on a scooter, and waited, not rushing in like before.
Observing them, Al-tok saw them behave how it expected humans would~
*Al-tok glanced around*
~Not one raiding party, everyone acting as if...~
*Al-tok took the next host when this one's heart gave out*
~People rushed over to help, but Al-tok was focused on that bit of algera that was supposed to be in every human heart~
'AT::Where is it?'
~Al-tok didn't sense algera in any of its hosts, but for how long?
It had been so focused on the namshub, it didn't remember...~
'AT::What took it out?
And where is it?'
~The harmonic resonance of a human scream was a delight to Al-tok's hearing. 
Every time a host died in the crowd there was an eruption.
Another delightful scream came from the door, indicating someone had found the bodies in the kitchen~
*The neighbors scattered*
~Finally fearing for their lives in earnest, unsure of what was going on~
*One by one Al-tok took them all*
~Regardless of how far they ran they all fell~
~To its frustration, none of them had algera~
~Al-tok waited, it would wait for days.
One body was just enough to fit the tip, the edge of Al-tok~
~So he would stay in a few at a time~

*Kent held his badge*
'K::You doing alright there, Kent?'
~He was not~
~Kent was wrapped up in more than he could chew. 
He had far too little sleep, no gun, no backup, no plan~
"K::Now we're firebombing cities?"
~Others could hear his question, but it was directed at himself~
'K::Or just letting it happen, Flanagan made the call'
"A::If we can't use the way out, We need to make sure he doesn't have a physical presence anymore."
~He should have stopped Flanagan~
'K::And did you have time?
Once you knew what he did?'
~Kent admitted he didn't have that time~
"FL__F::If it still has a body, it doesn't have Alice's lab, or that serum."
'K::Sounds like you should maybe not beat yourself up about it.'
"A::yes, you've made it more desperate: good job. /s"
*Kent glanced at Martha*
~She too had that far off stare of things escalating too quickly~
"FL__F::I was stalling it."
