~Martha's vision burned, the pain was in her skin, all around her.
It was the same pain that happened when Rossin and her switched places, only turned up to 11~
~She had her eyes closed but everything was white, she couldn't hear anything. 
The pain subsided, and she felt her voice horse~
'M::Was I screaming?'
~She opened her eyes, the pain was lowering but everything was still white.
Slowly things came into focus.
She was in Flanagan's foyer, holding the mirror: squeezing it~
"K::Martha?"
~Kent was standing over her, behind him was Flanagan~
"FL__F::It's one thing to push her in from a dream..."
"A::Are you back yet?"
~Martha's head was still clearing, waking from a dream~
*She sat up*
"M::Al-tok has the spear."
"A::Did you get it?"
"K::Spear?"
"FL__F::The one that...?"
"A::Did you find it, Martha?"
"M::That one."
"A::Martha!"
"M::Yes, I got it."
"A::Good. 
Not having a ship is really inconvenient.
Just keep it safe for now."
"FL__F::We have bigger worries.
Al-tok has a direct connection to every human heart.
Martha, what happened?"
'R::We happened, I...
I wanted to change the system, I wanted you to.
In so doing we built the tool of our destruction.'
~Martha explained the dream~
"FL__F::This isn't the worse.
It still needs Alice's serum to exist in a host.
It wants to consume, not just kill us."
"K::So you're saying it's not going to kill everyone on the planet in one go?"
"FL__F::I don't know."
*The phone rang*
*Flanagan tilted his head, but walked behind the desk and pulled out a small device*
~It had two round holes and a grey display in front~
*Flanagan picked up the phone and placed it in this device*
~A short while later words appeared~
~'Is Martha there?'~
*Flanagan held a finger to his mouth*
'R::Is that Al-Tok?'
~'An echo, she is.
Come outside: so you - '~
*The machine clicked and flanagan placed the phone back in its cradle*
'FL__F::If that was - '
*The phone rang again, and flanagan placed it back into the device*
~'Come outside: so you can be free.
I want to thank you.'~
"FL__F::We'll stay here."
~'I'll come to you.'~

todo:
     Narrator:"Martha"
    ~Martha receives a phone call - it's al-tok in the body of family~
    ~Al-tok~'s access to any human heart means it can take over for a short time.
      - this is a death sentence

  Narrator:"Felix"
    ~Felix~ is seething in the back seat of his mind
        - is prevented from hearing parts of the conversation
        - finds away around this while watching the following:
    ~Alacira~ and ~Flanagan~ 'nuke'(firebomb) the lab - destroying the physical presence of ~Al-Tok~.
        - which does not remove al-tok from the link, but without a physical body, Al-tok can't directly run namshubs.
        
        
    Narrator:"Al-tok" - Al-tok now only physically exists in the people temporarily taken over.
        - with no access to the serum he does not have the time to make it in a single body.
        - Al-tok has to body hop (be in at least one body) before the death of the host, otherwise it will loose permissions.
            - Al-tok doesn't want to burn through its stock too quickly.

    Narrator:"Kent"
        ~Kent~ holds his badge, contemplates what he's now involved with
        ~The navigator~ and ~Kent~ rejoin

        ~Robert/Alice~ in the body of ~Alacira's lost shipmate~ (
            write this in somewhere in dream chapters.
        ) ~ enters and informs them why they messed up in the second interludes
