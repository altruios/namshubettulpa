"M::How far down does this go."
"FL::A safe distance."
~Martha walked down smooth lead-layed passage.
There was a slight curve to the steps, outlining some huge pillar to her right~
'M::Hands and arms away from the lead walls, inside the staircase at all times.'
~She felt the hair rise up on her arms, due to cold or a faint buzzing of electricity.
Small LEDs in sconces spilt orange, reflecting on the lead~
'R::Okay this Al-tok thing - better analogy: a tick.'
`"Tick?"`
'R::It attached itself to us via the link, sucked out a bunch of the Algera from the Awakened.'
`"Okay, no: so what is Algera?"`
'R::Here is a data file on it...'
`
[algera](/namshubettulpa/world/algera.md)`
}
{
*They stopped walking at the landing of the stairs*
~A small rounded door made of dark oak stood closed in front of them~
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Dark oak floors and walls ended less than an arms length, matching the door perfectly in color~
'M::How was this all built?'
~Inside lay another door, made of finely, tightly meshed copper wire.
In the narrow passage between the two doors lay an electrical panel with one switch~
*Flanagan pulled it down*
'M::This is a lot of lead...'
*The faint buzzing suddenly ceased*
~Martha hadn't noticed it until it was silenced~
*Flanagan stepped forward and opened the wire door*
~Beyond the wire door was a blackness reflecting back both her and Flanagan's face.
Smooth as glass~
'It reminds me of obsidian...'
"M::What's with all the doors?"
~Martha saw the same copper color lead into the cube, a bridge~
"FL::Privacy, my dear, from many things..."
*Martha walked to the wire gate*
~Beyond it she saw the black reflection was actually a colossal cube of obsidian~ 
~It was evenly surrounded by a gap then wire mesh, extending from the gate encompassing the dark oak room~
'M::How far down is...'
~They were a short distance away from the cube, less than 20 feet~
*Martha looked down*
~Her stomach knotted, the sense of scale sunk in.
It would be a long fall.
The air was unnaturally still - at seeing that depth she thought even indoors there should have been a breeze~
*Flanagan walked across the short bridge*
~The copper handrails crunched and rattled at Flanagan's grasp as he crossed.
It was made of that same copper wire mesh.
Flanagan reached the end - a small landing platform extending from the cube - made of the obsidian~
*Flanagan pressed in his palm on a part of the obsidian and it sunk in.
He repeated this in several other locations on the smooth reflective surface.
Martha crossed the bridge*
~Taking careful steps and not looking down~
*Finally he swung a door open*
'M::Okay, not obsidian...'
~Inside was a dark hallway~
*He walked forward and beckoned her to follow*
~She noticed the successively smaller set of cubes she was walking into~
'M::Wood, copper, wizard-glass...'
~Each a layer around the room she was stepping into~
"FL::The doors, please."
*Flanagan's hand reached toward another electrical switch*
~This one however, was made of the same black glass.
Martha looked and found a handle on the other side of door.
She heard the electricity hum alive outside~
*Martha pulled the door shut*
}
{
~Inside was a pure dark.
Flanagan stood at the end of the small hallway.
His voice echoed from that far away, at least~
"FL::Beyond this next door no outside light has ever reached, inside here could be anything."
"M::Have you been inside?"
"FL::Oh yes, many times."
'R::This is going to work.'
`"What is going to work?"`
"FL::We are going to steal some Algera, hopefully all of it."
*Rossin shrugged and gestured to where Flanagan should be*
~Martha was started to still see him, alone in the dark~
'M::Right: I see him with my brain.'
"M::How?"
"FL::We are heading into the link. 
We are going to boldly pierce through a collection of thoughts and ideas and steal the power behind them."
`"Mosquito on a tick."`
'R::Awkward analogy, mosquitos do not feed on ticks.'
"M::So what exactly does this look like?"
"FL::Look like?"
"M::What exactly are we going to do?"
"FL::That thing inside your head, it has a signature of it's owner - we are going to use it to go right to it."
"M::Right to it?"
"FL::Then I'm going to poke a hole it in, you are going to suck up the Algera."
*Flanagan took her hand in his*
"FL::This is very important, keep this strong in your mind."
*He grasped her hand tighter*
"FL::We are holding hands, as an idea, as a concept: keep it as an anchor."
'R::I do not know if I can follow you into the link.'
"FL::Don't spread out too thin."
"M::Too thin?"
"FL::Yes: keep your thoughts together, don't let them spread out too far.
I'm leading us through the beast: you have to find it first - just focus on holding my hand and don't get lost."
"M::We're going into the link?"
'Wait, us physically into the link? 
How does that work?'
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha nodded her head, then a moment later squeezed his hand*
"M::Let's go."
'R::Best of luck, and do not overwrite anything important...'
'M::Overwrite?'
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Both felt gravity shift - towards the door~
*They fell in*

~Felix was engrossed in his phone on the park bench~
*Kent looked around in all directions*
~Watching for anything out of the ordinary.
At Felix's mimed request~
'K::He has been on his phone for a while now.'
*Kent leaned over*
'K::They made him mute, I doubt he is pretending.'
"K::Hey!"
~Felix had the top half of his screen covered, and below was a terminal~
'He was writing some sort of code..'
*Felix held out a finger to him, and he kept on typing*
~Kent lost interest until~ 
*Felix uncovered the other half of his screen*
~It was a bunch of squiggles~
*Felix convulsed in place - his right eye twitched*
'K::Sort of like what I saw on that one building.'
~Kent noticed Felix spasms just as they stopped~
*Felix groaned and stretched his neck*
"F::There we are, nasty little trick."
*Felix stretched his jaw*
"F::Now, about you..."
*Felix fiddled with his phone some more*
"K::Okay, you can talk now? 
Felix, Who are you?"
*Felix froze halfway to shoving the phone in Kent's face*
"F::Who are you?"
"K::Kent, and give me that!"
*Kent swiped the phone from Felix's stunned hand*
"K::Using this...
What ever this..."
~Kent fumbled for his works, he was tired, and~
*Kent shook the phone at Felix*
"F::Whatever this... 
Are you Awakened?"
~Kent did not hesitate~
"K::What do you think?"
~There was a pause~
"F::I mean, I asked the question - so..."
"K::What was that back there? 
That group?"
"F::That group?"
"K::Girl was part of it, that guy whose head you bashed in was too."
"F::The one that spilt that black goo?"
"K::What is that black goo, Felix?"
*Felix turned to him*
"F::You want to give me back my phone?"
"K::So you can call a horde of zombies on your side in a second, no thanks."
"F::Then why should I tell you anything?"
~Kent paused briefly~
"K::Martha sent me here."
"F::How do you know Martha?"
"K::Questions later - answers now: who are those people?"
*Felix squinted his eyes*
~He continued slowly~
"F::That was Alice Glass...
But that wasn't her that we killed."
"K::You killed: you swung."
"F::You sung that stupid song wrong: that was deadly in of itself..."
*Kent pinched his eyebrows*
"K::What do they want?"
"F::Probably to take over everything."
"K::Everything?"
"F::Everything.
Every thought, every dream, every conscious action taken in its name."
~Kent contemplate that~
"K::So like: fanatical religious nuts?"
*Felix let out a sigh*
"F::Okay, walk and talk.
We need to get back to Flanagan's."
'K::That a bar, or a person?'
~Kent kept his question quite~
"K::First we head back there."
*Felix stared at kent*
~Blankly~
"F::Why?"
"K::I dropped a thing I stole from them, near the gutter."
*Kent held out Felix's phone, and started walking*
"K::Come on."
*Felix groaned*
~The two walked onwards in silence back to the alley.
When they arrived the scene was as it had been.
People walked down the street not even looking~
"K::Keep an eye out!"
*Kent pointed to the alley door.
Felix looked all around before watching the door.
Kent inspected the gutter*
"K::It was right here."
*Kent scoured the area*
"K::It was..."
~He had checked both cars - they were the same ones parked, he was pretty sure~
'K::...Somebody call the gangs...'
"K::That guy took it."
'K::He was bent down over there...'
"F::That guy?"
"K::Call the gangs."
"F::He has it? 
Well good look finding him."
"K::With my luck he'll shoot himself up with it, or sell it to a junkie."
"F::Wait - what did you steal?"
"K::A syringe...
That they were giving out."
"F::And a homeless man has it now?"
~A silence fell over them~
"F::We should find that man."
*Kent sighed*
"K::Got any nifty tricks to do that?"
'K::Do not give him his phone back...'
*Felix reached out his hand for his phone*
"F::A few..."

~The link was visceral, Martha was unprepared~
*She fell and kept falling into a repeating fractal of herself*
~The center of this fractal-self was a hole, dark and in her silhouette~ 
*Martha squeezed through an outline of herself*
'M::A bit cramped...'
*She was falling toward some bottom*
~She saw below her a moving shadow-play: a reflection of her own movements.
All around her: a full spectral spread of pieces of her life lined the edges~
~~
~Those too moved like a slowed down projector~
~~
~There was a gap between each moment~
~~
~~
~Martha felt that gap grow wider~
~~
~~
~~
*Martha leaned to her left*
~~
~~
~~
~~
~~
*She found her self against a barrier*
~~
~~
~~
~~
~~
~Almost like soap~
~~
~~
~~
~~
~~
~~
*She broke through*
~~

~She found herself on the grass~ 
~It was night, and she was in a large grass field, trees surrounding all sides except~
~She heard a noise to her left, a wooden impact~
*She looked left*
~And was watching herself storm out of the back of the mansion she had been in a few nights ago~
"M::Oh... well then."
*Martha sat up on the grass*
'M::Must be a memory...'
~She felt the soft sponge of the grass, it was perfect~
~There was another door closing~
*She looked back up.
Rossin was following the Martha that had stormed out*
"M::Rossin!"
~He looked briefly startled, almost like waking up from a dream~
*He walked across the yard to where she lay*
"R::Not quite, I'm a memory of Rossin, not the quality original.
But... 
I think I can get him here, since I am here, sort of a switcheroo."
*Martha sat up*
"M::Anything I need to do?"
"R::Let him through."
*Rossin pointed to the left* 
~There was an edge to the memory - leading back to that space~
~And between the memory, and that space was a gap - wide as a small field~
~~
~It was slowly growing~
~~
*Martha approached the edge*
~~
~Martha compared herself to being inside a finger - the gap was a ring~
*She leaned over*
~In that gap Rossin appeared, partially immaterial, bounded behind some barrier~
*There was a crack*
~~
~Another Rossin to her left was banging on the barrier~
*The Rossin in front of her shook his head and backed away*
~More and more appeared until it was not empty~
~Just a writhing mass of Rossin's stuck together~
~~
"R::I'd step away if I were you."
~~
~~
*She did*
~~
"R::Looks like we missed our chance."
'M::What did Flanagan say?'
~Martha thought of her hand, her hand holding Flanagan's~
*Flanagan's flesh and clothing grew out of her hand until he was standing beside her.
He looked up*
~Above him was the gap, writhing copies of Rossin swirled and licked some invisible barrier~
*He looked to Rossin then back up*
"FL::That was not what I expected."
"M::It's a mask."
"FL::That I know, but... never-mind - just be cautious."
"M::So where is my body right now?"
"FL::What do you mean?"
"M::Am I asleep in the cube?"
"FL::Martha, dear: you're in the link. your body is right here."
*Martha felt at herself*
~She seemed solid enough~
'M::But before...'
~Before when she endlessly fell in on herself.~
"M::But I'm physical, the link isn't..."
"FL::Who said that? 
If it exists: it's physical."
~Martha paused, and after a few breaths felt a little calmer~
"M::So what - I'm really physically here in my own memory?"
"FL::As am I."
"M::Can't we dream our way in."
"FL::We used the backdoor for a reason, we do not want to be noticed...
And we want certain privileges..."
"M::Also - Why can't Rossin be here?"
"FL:: He's a tulpa, He's not a person, like you or I..."
*Flanagan and Rossin shook their heads*
~For separate reasons~
"FL::Time to go either way, we don't have forever."
"M::What exactly is the plan?"
*Flanagan pointed to the writhing mass of bodies in the void*
"FL::See that - we go inside that - and yes: before you ask. it's going to hurt."
*Flanagan coughed*
"FL::Like a lot, probably.
Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best."
"M::Then what?"
"FL::In there: we find a way to our little shadow king."
~Martha waited~
"FL::Then I'm going to poke it, and whatever comes out, you need to drink."
*Flanagan flourished his hand and brandished a forearmed sized thin needle*
"FL::Hm - what else..."
*Flanagan waved his arm again and a large funnel settled in his hand.
He handed it to her*
~She inspected it, to have a cover she couldn't see a seam to~
"FL::Hold it out and be ready, a small sample."
*He held the funnel in one hand, thumb over the lid* 
~He waited until Martha took the hose~
"FL::It's a filter - it's alright."
*And with the other took his needle and sliced his thumb*
"FL::Only Algera flows."
*Droplets of blood collected on the surface of the lid - but something else slipped through*
~Martha waited for it to flow down the tube~
*It reached her lips, it was a drop*
~It was cold and hot, it was every extreme.
It was a pure experience: her lips, then her tongue touching a pure expression of data.
A flooding sense of infinity - filling small holes.
Though it had hardly made a dent in the larger gaps~
'M::Divinity!'
~A pure and blinding divinity.
A transcending moment, where things clicked into place.
A sense of oneness in the universe, Her life a fractal pattern not just of herself, but of the link.
She knew the link: a connection, it was more than what anyone had told her..
It was understanding that flooded her.
There was a center to that connection, far away..
All at once it stopped, she was standing next to Flanagan.
An idea she had, now unsupported by the direct infusion of Algera, tumbled and cracked, scattered to the aether robbing her of an epiphany~
"M::Holy shit."
~It was as if every moment of her life had been curled up - and presented as a singular idea~
'M::A freer!'
~That was what she was, deep down~
*She inspected her hand*
~As if for the first time... as for a way, it was the first time - knowing what those hands would do~ 
*Flanagan took her shoulder, and she caught the filtered funnel in her outstretched hand*
~She kept the sadness out of her face, the coming betrayal~
"FL::That was from a drop of my blood - I have more than a few...
But Martha - I want to impress upon you - two thirds of the awakened's Algera is stuck in that thing.
You might be... 
Occupied for a time by so much Algera."
"M::Occupied?"
~Martha didn't know all the rules, but that small amount of Algera let her know some things~
*Martha extended her hand*
`-cp G.Objects.jar --~mason~ --~glass~ , *hand*`
*Glass crystallized as her brain processed a new jar in her hand.*
"FL::Algera spoils outside of a host..."
'M::Okay, so - outside a host...'
"M::When you say spoil?"
"FL::Evaporate, here - may I?"
*Martha nodded.
Flanagan shuffled his hands in Martha's direction*
`-tf {
    ~outside~:~steel~,
    ~inside~:-sym link - creator.*heart*
}.then((r)=>r.set(~Permissions~,750)
`
~Her cup changed, from glass to metal, and came with a lid.~
*Her heart pulsed* 
~She felt it echo from the cup in her hand~
"M::Oh that feels weird."
"FL::Keep your heart protected, and set your default permissions."
~Martha looked at the funnel and the jar~
'M::Default permissions: right.'
`defaults.set(~permissions~, 750)`
'M::Okay - I can do this: this is easy...'
"R::You can do this."
'M::Dream Rossin says so, does that count...'
~She decided it did: she would have to let him know~
"M::Hand me that spike of yours."
*Flanagan did so, *
~She thought a moment longer - then started~
`
-cmb ~this~ => [...self.hands[0].Objects[0], 
  -cp G.Objects.armor{~carbon fiber~,*Moulded*}, 
  ...(for x in 10: 
    -cp G.Objects.spike{
      ~Prototype~:self.hands[1].Objects[0],
      ~style~:*Barbed*,
      *length*:~1ft~, 
    ~Location~:~Front corner at {2xπ(this.front.radius)}~
    }
    )    
    ] --auto-format --light-weight --resizable
`
*The cup and funnel morphed in her hands* 
~Mostly like she pictured in her head.
The items combined into a short spear - spikes and the funnel at the end~
"M::This isn't going to kill it though, is it?"
"FL::No, no it won't.
It is far too spread out for that."
'M::This is just like stealing treasure from a dragon, yep... 
And with this treasure...'
~She contemplated what she would do with that store of power~
*Martha looked above her*
'M::Rossin said it would be months before she would be ready...'
~She studied it some more.
She had Flanagan by her side after all~
"M::Can we kill that thing at least?"
*Martha tilted her head towards the thing*
~Flanagan considered~
"FL::After we get the Algera out, before that it's going to be our way in, and our way out."
"M::Any other way out... 
Or in?"
"FL::Out, maybe - but in... that's the way."
'M::Okay, less than ideal, he will not help me after...'
~Martha suppressed the thought~
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha nodded*
'M::Thread the needle Martha... 
Keep it together.'
}
{
    %%%%
}
{
*Martha held his hand*
~That was a constant~
*She held tight as she and Flanagan tore through the skin of the copies of Rossin clawing at them*
~Flanagan had ripped open a hole~
'M::THE hole!'
~The one from her childhood, the one at the back of her mind~
'M::How long have you been there?'
~She panicked, that hole was death, worse than death.
It promised so much worse from her nightmares as a child~
*they slid through.
She was thrust through a void*
~~
~~
~~
~~
~With the sudden blindness came pain~
'M::Just hold his hand.'
*She did.
Her shoulder was cut*
~An edge of memory cut her physically~
`"Why!?" ~She was crying~`
~She couldn't remember why~
~~
~~
~As she fell deeper into the void the memories grew denser~
~~
~~
~She was racked not just with bodily pain: she was riven by edges of the link of memories the entity co-opted, each connected to a moment of pain~
`~The betrayal of a lover, discovered through an intercepted message~`
`~The loss of a child, by looking the wrong way at at just the wrong moment~`
`~The hate in the eyes of your parents, after killing their grandchild~`
~Worse, and still:~ 
*She held his hand*
~Each moment cutting her, now a part of her~ 
~She compartmentalized them as best she could.
Her panicked mind was not helping~
*Still, she held his hand*
~There was no light, no concept of light, not even the equivalent of being able to see.
Every connection in the entity was shrouded, shifting, and impenetrable..
Until she was cut by an memory's edge, which was often, she might as well have been in a void~
"M::How are we going to find anything in here."
~There was no response~
'M::Can he hear me?'
~Martha waited, still nothing~
~~
'M::Okay... 
Girl scouts was useful for something...'
~~
~~
*Martha squeezed .... --- .-- / .-.. --- -. --.*
~~
~~
~~
~A short time later she felt something back in her hand~
~~
~~
~~
~~
~~
*... --- --- -.*
~~
~~
'M::Okay, so I guess I just wait?'
~~
~Martha contemplated how she might kill this thing~
~~
'M::You seem much bigger, but...'
~It couldn't actually be this big, it was just in her head, one brain...~
~~
~She had to be larger - she reasoned... but maybe not stronger~
'M::No: it is in me, not the link...'
~Those had been her memories, she realized~
~~
~Divorced from her by Rossin - and used by this thing as a sort of fuel~
'M::I had a daughter?'
~~
~~
~~
~She tried to remember her face~
~~
~~
~~
~~
~She couldn't~
~~
~~
~~
*Another memory cut into her*
~~
~She couldn't accept it~
~She buried that one deep down~
~~
~~
~~
~~
*Martha's feet hit a floor*
~She was in a memory, her own.
A row of books on either side of her.
A dark emerald colored carpet at her feet~
"M::Flanagan?"
"FL::Over here!"
*He squeezed her hand*
~Which had nothing in it~
*Martha looked around*
~Flanagan was nowhere in sight.
Some movement behind the books caught her eye~
"FL::I'm in the other row."
*He tugged at her*
"FL::This way!"
*Martha looked down at her hand*
~She was still holding his hand, she could tell, but it wasn't there.
She felt it, and him pulling on her to come.
It was as if he had an invisible stretchy arm that could pass through walls... of books at least.
Martha let herself be led on~
