~Felix awoke to his face staring back at him in the mirrored ceiling~
~The original owners still kneeling at the foot of a king size bed~
*He yawned - stretched himself awake*
*Then shifted through clothing of the man's walk-in closet*
~He was roughly the same size~
"F::Go make us some breakfast - some eggs, and waffles"
~Felix said without turning back~
~Inside the closet was a mirror. ~
~Inside of which several drawers for cufflinks. ~
~To his right were suits - from white, to black and most colors in between~
~He felt like standing out today~
'A nice red suit'
~Something to catch the eyes~
~He was back in the city:~
'Might as well be seen.'
~Felix inspected the dress shirt~
~Yes he was almost exactly the same size as Felix~
*He rolled the cufflinks in his fingers, shifting them into place*
}
{
~He brought the girl down the stairs~
~She was much younger than the man he sent to the kitchen~
~The man was over the stove, watching the eggs~
"F::Scrambled,"
*Felix said, and the man started fixing the eggs. *
~The waffle iron beeped~
~And moments later Felix was presented with a hearty meal~
~Complete with milk~
*He tipped the glass at the man, then to the woman*
"F::Thank you for your service, go eat some yourselves."
*He nodded - then drank*
~He suspected they were in fact: horrible people~
~Considering the house they lived in~
'No one had this much money and got it by being kind or nice,'
*He thought while scarfing down the food*
*Felix handed them the plate*
*Then he took out his phone and started fiddling with it*
*He typed a long while, eventually he pressed one button*
*And held the phone out in front of their faces*
~Their eye's twitch - a sign the namshub was taking~
~He wrote them to be philanthropists~
~Fundraisers for the poor~
'That was a good thing'
~He told himself~
'They were probably horrible people - why not make them better.'
}
{
*He walked off*
~Taking the keys to their large SUV~
~The really expensive brand only douches drove~
~He always wondered what the appeal was - now was his turn~
~He should check that Martha was listening - that she found somewhere safe~
~He accessed the back of the mind, the link - searching - only to not find her~
*He nodded to himself*
~He did not know how she hid from the ping~
~But that she was clearly holding back~
~What was her game?~
}
{
~He drove aimlessly for a long while~
~He watched the fuel plummet on the inefficient vehicle~
~He was weaving through traffic just for the fun of it~
~So far he hadn't caused any accidents~
~In the rear view mirror - he saw flashing blue and red lights~
*He sighed and calmly pulled over*
~He waited for the motorcycle cop to knock on his window~
*He rolled it down*
"P::Do you know why I pulled you over?"
"F::Probably because I was driving like a reckless jackass, I suspect."
*The cop tilted his head - and put his hand on his gun*
"F::Oh relax - I'm harmless - I've got my license and registration here"
*He held out his phone for the cop to see*
*The cop stiffened slightly - his eye had started twitching*
"F::Who's a good boy?"
~The cop didn't answer~
"F::When I say, who's a good boy, you say: I am, sir, now - who's a good boy?"
"P::I am, sir."
"F::Now, go back to your little bike back there - and forget all about me"
*The officer retreated back to the bike*
*Felix sighed*
~Sometimes it wasn't any fun to have to tell them exactly what to say~
'wait a minute.'
"F::Come back here."
*The officer complied, suddenly turning back to him*
"F::Am I to understand that - when I asked 'who was a good boy', that you couldn't answer because you were not in fact a good boy?"
*The officer responded the moment he understood*
"P::Yes sir."
"F::have you been a...
A bad cop?"
"P::Yes sir."
"F::Have you intentionally ruined people's lives?"
"P::Yes sir."
'f::Not going to tolerate that'
"F::Do you know any other bad cops."
"P::Yes sir."
*Felix nodded*
"F::Go take your gun."
*The officer pulled out the gun* 
'bit of a quick draw... good.'
"F::Now here's the important bit - do you want to be a good cop?"
*The cop paused*
~He struggled~
"P::I want to want to be good."
"F::We can work with that - Now: go and shoot the bad cops.
Shoot them in the head. 
Until they shoot you in the head.
That'll make you a good cop."
~He watched the Officer walk back to his car~
"F::Oh and be smart about it: get as many as you can."
~He even heard some of the radio chatter - an invitation to a donut shop~
"F::That'll do pig, that'll do."
}
{
*Felix drove on*
~His stomach growled: he had breakfast, but not second breakfast~
~He exited the highway and scanned the streets for somewhere fancy to eat~
~Not that there was much around here~
'F::Nothing but trash food for disgusting people.'
~But he would find something~
~He always did~

mn:M
~Light danced across the white cloth table~
*Martha ideally played with the curtain drawstring of the window next to her*
~Rossin sitting across from her, he only had to switch to allow them in~
~He insisted on only the most expensive place to eat~
~He claimed that there was a higher quality to the food~
~And that she would need it~
~The other patrons wore fancy clothes~
*They stole small snapshots from fancy phones*
~The pictures were of her bloody shirt~
~She watched them~
~Most fiddled with phones, other's stifled laugher~
'R::Martha, would you mind...'
}
{
*He glanced at where she was looking, turned back to her and nodded*
*She flipped the switch*
mn:R
~Her perspective twisted about until she saw Rossin in her place~
`Hooks.ignore(~Self~) && .delete(~Media~.contain(~Self~) | break.`
*She turned and saw the phones slip back into purses and tuxedo suit pants*
"R::Martha, before you switch back..."
*She nodded*
'M::What is it?'
*A server passed though her - she reacted only slightly*
~She felt nothing - but still had braced for a crash~
"R::I would like to taste some of the food, if that's alright."
*She nodded*
"R::I've never done so, and I'm so curious."
~Her stomach was hungry but her body was being fed~
~She concluded it didn't matter by whom~
'M::Not all of it, but yes.
Just leave at least half for me.'
}
{
*He nodded*
"R::Then mind if I have the first bite?"
*Martha nodded, looking around*
'M::I have a question: how far can I go in...
This state?
Like if I just walk into the blackness behind you?'
"R::I wouldn't, besides: that thing in your brain is somewhere in there."
*He placed a napkin in her lap - properly*
"R::While you're there.
Do you see the board any easier - why don't you try writing on it"
}
{
~She did~
~It was like learning to walk - unsure of which muscles to use~
~Only in this case: the muscles were some part of her brain~
~Occasionally she managed to move the cursor, or write a letter~
~But each time felt like an accident - and not what she intended~
}
{
~She still had to close her eyes - even in this shadowy perspective~
~Her vision was still in front of her mind~
~Even if what she was seeing was an imagined perspective~
~Her mind still had to turn to face the board~
*She leaned back*
~Frustrated, unable to even make even a single letter~
~Try as she might, brute force of will was not enough~
}
{
*A server walked in front of her - a large steak meal was presented to her... *
~Rossin, that is, along with many side dishes, including lobster~
*She - Rossin, dug in*
'M::How am I supposed to do this? I can not write on that board at all.'
"R::Relax your mind, it's a new muscle - you haven't used it yet, it'll come."
~Rossin said between bites~
"R::This is delicious,"
~Martha tried for a while longer~
~Until Rossin was about halfway through the meal~
"R::You better switch now, I could finish this"
}
{
~She did, and the first thing she noticed her fingers felt off. ~
mn:M
~The second: ~
~The taste was wonderful. ~
~A sudden onslaught of umami and salt and sweetness... ~
~In the perfect combination. ~
~She sat there just enjoying the sensations~
*She shook her hand until her fingers felt normal*
~It seemed like it took longer this time than it had before~
*Rossin noticed her shaking hand*
'R::Like I said - it does just a little bit of damage each time we do that...
That will only get worse. 
Which is why you need to learn to write on that board yourself.'
*Martha nodded digging into the meal herself*
~The flavor in her mouth started to expire~
~Her stomach was near full, which did little to stop her hunger~
}
{
*Rossin looked over his shoulder*
~He saw something Martha herself caught in the corner of her eye~
*Rossin tensed as Felix sat down to join her*
"F::Lovely place you found here,"
*Felix casually helped himself to some of the half eaten artichoke*
"F::I thought you would still be asleep"
~Martha kept eating, only a non committal shrug~
"M::Hunger won"
"F::Hunger generally wins,"
*He leaned back*
"F::How are you hiding - I pinged you, and you weren't there."
}
{
~Martha waited for Rossin, who didn't speak at first~
'R::I have been doing some - house maintenance with our shared home. 
I put up a firewall between us and the link.
Just say it is a trick you learned on the internet.'
"M::You find all sorts of things on the internet."
~It was as cryptic a statement  she could make, she figured the more vague she was the better~
"F::That's a very useful trick, I was wondering how I would find you again."
"M::Well, How did you this time?"
"F::I didn't...
I found a nice place to eat, which happened to have you in it. 
Nice stroke of luck."
'R::It was the best place in town'
"M::That's good, why not eat at the very best."
}
{
*Felix leaned back and caught the server by the arm*
*He showed him the phone screen. *
*The server's eye started twitching*
"F::Go fetch me what she's having, from anywhere."
*The server nodded and scurried off to the kitchen*
}
{
"M::So, what's next?"
"F::Well, that depends,"
~He watched her take bites of the steak and lobster at the same time~
"M::On?"
"F::Your abilities, how far along are you?"
"M::I wouldn't know - would I.
It's not like I've seen anyone Awakened.
Besides you, that is.
Best I have is some dark net videos to compare from"
}
{
~Rossin was pacing back and forth deep in concerned thought~
*Felix leaned back further in his seat. *
*He put his feet up on the corner of the table*
"F::You haven't been to the back of the mind. 
You know about hooks but have at least some trouble using them. 
And you have a firewall on your brain...
But you spent the night in prison because you...
Felt like it..."
~He kept the end hanging almost like a question~
*Martha continued to eat*
"M::So where would you rank me?"
}
{
"F::Rank? 
You think this is like a school where you have defined grades"
"M::You said there was a school."
"F::Yes, it's more like - a collection of students with a private teacher."
"M::That's a school"
"F::There aren't ranks."
"M::But subjects, and classes in those subjects,"
*Martha swallowed the last of the steak*
"M::And grades?"
"F::No grades, if you can't cut it - they wipe you...
A pass/fail system I guess"
}
{
*Felix scooched his chair back as the server laid out another meal like her's*
"F::Here's to second breakfast"
*Felix raised the small cup of water in a toast*
*Martha grabbed her glass and clinked it against his*
*He held out his other hand, and took her glass and held it still*
*He first poured a bit of his drink in hers and vise versa*
*He then took some of his own food and put it on her plate*
~Martha pulled her glass back~
'Fuck he trusts no one.'
*He helped himself to a portion of her steak, and lobster*
~He dug into his food, devouring it with a ferocity that surprised her~
~She was hungry - but apparently not ferocity hungry~
`['Second breakfast - how many second meals', 
'Do they all eat like this',
'Do they all share food like that?']`
*She looked down at the piece of steak in front of her*
~She had a flash of inspiration - she tried just~
~She moved the list she made onto the board, and it instantly worked~
~The board flashed the words and Rossin looked surprised~
'R::Good job, what did you do?'
}
{
`['Those lists: I can just put them up here']`
'R::That is a start.'
*Rossin examined the board*
'R::about 4 second meals, more around noon, yes, and most of them yes - do not trust food they have not prepared.
I did not hear him ask the waiter to poison his food'
*Martha ate the offered steak*
'R::But you should also just be able to place thoughts there the same way. 
Not wrapped in a list'
*Felix switched to eat his own food*
}
{
"F::This is fucking delicious."
~Felix was gasping breaths of air between moments of food inhalation~
"F::New York's food is better.
You'd be hard pressed to find this even in Fiji. 
I've missed simple food like this."
"M::I've never been"
"F::Fiji?"
"M::Or New York."
*He nodded*
~She had never seen someone eat so fast~
"M::You know, the experience is better when you make it last."
*He tilted his head, then nodded*
~He was slowing down soon - but not by much~
}
{
"F::So...
What's the most impressive thing you can do?"
`['What should I tell him',
'Switch?']`
*Rossin considered, and shook his head, feeding her words instead*
"M::I have that block that prevents you from finding me. 
And I've removed most of my hooks myself."
~Felix paused.
Studying her~
"F::Yourself, you got them out: yourself."
*Martha nodded*
"F::Color me impressed."
}
{
~Martha finished the last bits of her meal~
~Her stomach was rebelling~
~Kept under control by her unsatiated brain~
~She could eat again~
'Soon,'
~She realized~
*Rossin was still pacing in the back of the room*
~He fed her more words~
"M::I've been doing some research.
 Do you know Professor Flanagan."
}
{
~Felix paused again~
"F::How did you come across that name?"
~Rossin continued and Martha parroted~
"M::Breadcrumbs - on the internet."
*Felix only smiled*~ - brittle and partially cracked~
"F::He's the only one that calls himself a professor...
Besides Ozmind - who is actually a Math teacher of sorts, 
Probably the only one of the Awakened that actually likes to teach...
Ozmind, not Flanagan. 
Flanagan never holds classes, just has a gaggle of students.
He's...
Eccentric is too light a word, and crazy...
Also too light a word, just in a different context.
He's died so many times I'm sure by now he's a caricature of himself"
*Martha tilted her head*
"F::He...
Probably isn't even really human at this point anymore. 
He's something like an idea made manifest. 
Or he's now just the part of himself that lives in other's brains."
*Felix ate another bite*
"F::He basically thinks he'll find immortality that way. 
By essentially being a story"
"M::A story?"
"F::Of himself, told by his students."
*Felix mumbled between mouthfuls*
}
{
*He swallowed*
"F::He always had some out there ideas...
Even for the Awakened - they were...
Out there."
"M::Like?"
*Martha sipped her water*
~Rossin gave words of encouragement~
`['Well clearly he is happy with the way things are going.']`
~She was relaxing knowing Rossin would be able to navigate the rough spots~
"F::Like Algera, or the Walkers.  
He thinks there's people that are more powerful than the Awakened. 
People behind the scenes controlling the Awakened... 
Or some smuggling thing happening between 'realities'"
*Felix scoffed*
"F::Or weirder stuff, real cosmic hippy love/horror story there."
}
{
*Martha leaned in*
"M::And that's more crazy than the awakened?"
"F::Well, Yes."
~He started~
"F::We're gods, we control the hearts and minds of everyone...
Everyone."
~Felix was not angry~
~Just determined to believe that~
*Rossin shook his head*
'R::Always the arrogance'
*Rossin shook his head slowly*
"F::We'd be able to control any Walker if they existed, which they don't. And this is definitely physical reality"
*Felix stubbed is index finger into the wood of the table*
}
{
~There was a pause, Rossin prompted her - pushed at that thread~
"M::He seems like an out-there kind of guy, would love to meet him."
"F::You will: just be patient."
*Felix took a sip of water*
~He let it dribble down his chin~
"M::Are you?"
"F::Am I what?"
"M::Patient?"
*Felix barked a laugh, then coughed to keep his food down*
"F::Hardly"
"M::Then why should I be?"
~Felix smiled more seriously, then at Rossin's prompt, Martha continued:~
"M::I can cut it there.
I'm wired for this."
}
{
*Felix nodded*
"F::Hope that you are, if you aren't...
Well...
Death would be better - in my opinion...
I know people like to cling to life...
But...
Sometimes - death is better."
~It was remorseful - hidden pain deep in memory~
~Martha waited, Rossin urging her to stay silent and wait~
~Finally Felix cleared his thoughts and continued~
"F::We'll take the red eye out tonight. 
Get whatever you need - not that you need to bring much. 
Until then:"
*He continued his meal*
"F::Enjoy what this city has to offer. 
You'll be in New York for a long while."
}
{
*Martha set down her empty plate*
*Then took a bit of artichoke from his*
*She ate it while Felix watched*
"F::Have a good meal, I have things to do then."
*Felix waved, dismissing her*
"F::7pm, airport - meet me at the front desk."
}
{
*Martha stood, she paused - and bowed before wandering off*
*Rossin followed at her side*
'R::Aye, that was good - going to New York. 
And I am pretty sure he is not just going to erase you...
He needs you for something...
But what'
*She opened the door*
~The sun was much too bright - or that restaurant was much too dark~
~She couldn't tell~
~She walked into the sun, suddenly hungry again~
