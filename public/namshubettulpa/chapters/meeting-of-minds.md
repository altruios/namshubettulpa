*Kent stuck out his hand*
~Keeping the lift doors from closing~
~Kent had the Chemist over one shoulder~
~The hospital bed would not fit in the elevator~
~Felix had said some 'not-words' to the dingy looking security guard~
'K::So he just uses words, why was he relying on his phone earlier?'
*Felix entered and pressed some numbers on a keypad*
~They made their descent~
'K::Okay Kent, they think you are in the know.
Just keep calm - and bluff your ass off.'
*The lift opened*
~A hallway of dark wood, leading to a door with an alcove on the right~
*Felix lead the way*
"K::Why do you think this one hasn't woken up yet?"
*Felix paused then shrugged*
"FL__F::Chemistry?"
*Felix again pushed some buttons on a pin pad and the door opened*
~Kent followed into room seemingly designed to be as garish as possible~
"FL__F::To the right after the foyer, there are fainting couches, put him there"
*Kent moved to the other room*
~To find Martha, and a fish-man talking~
'K::Keep it together, so there is a fish-man, so what?'
"NT::$Ehime:"
~Kent saw a man that looked almost exactly like him: except the part of his face that was missing~
"A::You're supposed to be in a coma."
~A woman in a white captain's coat was standing at a desk to his right~
*She walked up to him*
"A::Shit, Flanagan?"
"FL__F::No, over here."
*Felix walked in*
"K::You're Flanagan?"
"FL__F::As of 30 minutes ago, thanks for the heimlich - that would have been a short life other wise"
'K::Keep your mouth shut Kent.' 
~He did however keep a mental inventory of questions~
'K::Can they all hop bodies?
Coma - how do they know about the accident?
Why does that man look like me - what happened to him?
Is Felix dead now?'
"K::Where's Felix?"
"FL__F::He's right here, just in the back seat"
*Felix wandered over to a corner coffee desk and made himself some tea*
"FL__F::Also, hello Alacira, Gerald: I didn't think you were still alive"
*Kent sat down on the couch across from Martha, and leaned in*
~He more mouthed the words that used his voice~
"K::Do you have my gun?"
~Martha hesitated, matching his volume~
"M::It's in a car upstairs."
*Kent gave a subtle nod*
"A::It is Kent, correct?"
*Again Kent nodded*
~More broadly this time~
~This captain looked to Kent's double, then back to him~
"A::Interesting"
~Sonny chittered at a balding man in an ill-fitted uniform~
"G::How are things outside?"
"K::Not good"
'K::Why was she chittering?'
"FL__F::I've had time to think on what went wrong.
I think we grossly underestimated the amount of algera it had accumulated."
"A::We?"
"FL__F::I. If Martha gave an equal amount to everyone..."
'K::So Martha did this?'
'K::What are you doing, Kent?'
~Kent watched Martha, and thought of Tom~
~Of the burns, of him in the hospital bed~
'K::If all it takes is a few words...'
~He couldn't get justice, nor would he settle for vengeance~
"A::Not exactly everyone, just most"
"FL__F::And it was that much, that was probably the best way forward"
"G::What do you mean?"
"M::So it could have killed me."
~She said it to herself~
"FL__F::Well, it's not accumulating that much Algera to do anything good.
Dispersing it means it will be harder to recollect."
"A::No, assholes will just funnel it to themselves.
That'll keep happening until there's a tight nit group that doesn't hate each other."
*Felix took a sip of his tea, and sat down*
"FL__F::Still, that will take time, and it's better than destroying that much Algera."
"A::What was your plan?"
"FL__F::Put the Algera in Martha over there."
*He pointed to Martha across the table*
"FL__F::She was hollowed out to about a week ago, she's in her mid-thirties."
"G::Do you know how much Algera that thing had?"
"FL__F::More or less, less than more it turns out."
"A::Orders of magnitude less I think"
~Kent sat quietly absorbing the conversation so far~
*Kent leaned his head back against the couch briefly*
~He nearly screamed. 
Above him in the rafters were two giant spiders.
They had a large web built already~
'K::No, no one else is freaked out'
~Martha caught his eye~
*She pointed to the ceiling, and gave a thumbs up*
'K::Okay, good spiders. 
How about you not look at the good spiders'
"FL_F::Martha, who is he?"
*Felix, Flanagan, whoever that was, pointed at him*
"A::Yeah, he's supposed to be in a coma"
"M::That's it?
Not even an apology you almost killed me?"
"FL_F::Yes, yes: sorry you almost died.
Your first death is the scariest."
"FL_F::Now, Kent - how do you know Martha?"
~Kent took a moment, enclosed as he was he couldn't panic~
"K::She killed a friend of mine, I'm trying to make that right"
"FL_F::Oh, and you can't bring him back?"
"K::She did it with her neighbor, new body - right?"
"M::You want me to bring him back?"
~Martha paused~
"M::Did he have any friends, or family"
"K::Me."
"M::Other than you?"
"K::I'm not sure actually, people that knew him, sure... but friends?"
"FL_F::Why other friends?"
~Martha paused~
"K::Cause I'm immune"
"A::Immune?"
"G::But of course, the Navigator is here"
"M::What?"
"G::The part of him that's in the Link - is the Navigator"
"A::Immune to..."
~Alacira trailed off and spoke words that weren't words at him~
*Nothing happened*
"FL_F::Interesting"
"A::Wish I had known that before I parked..."
"G::Did you dream of a ship?"
"K::I don't dream"
~The response was automatic~
"K::No, wait, I did have a dream, earlier today."
"A::Good to know the ship is safe... probably."
