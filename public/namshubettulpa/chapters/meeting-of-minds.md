*Kent stuck out his hand.
The lift doors bounced back, once... twice...*
~Kent was instructed to watch the security guard, right in the eyes~
~He had the Chemist over one shoulder, the hospital bed would not fit in the elevator~
~Felix had said some 'not-words' to the dingy looking security guard sitting in the corner~
'K::So he just uses words, why was he relying on his phone earlier?'
*Felix entered and pressed some numbers on a keypad*
~Kent relaxed his hand and the doors finally closed~
~They made their descent~
'K::Okay Kent, they think you are in the know.
Just keep calm - and bluff your ass off.'
*He shifted the chemist*
~The chemist was short, but he ate well~
*The lift opened*
~A hallway of dark wood, leading to a door with an alcove on the right~
*Felix led the way*
"K::Why do you think this one hasn't woken up yet?"
*Felix paused, then shrugged*
"FL__F::Chemistry?"
*Felix again pushed some buttons on a pin pad and the door opened*
~Kent followed into a room seemingly designed to be as garish as possible~
"FL__F::To the right after the foyer, there are fainting couches, put him there"
*Kent moved to the other room*
~To find Martha, and a fish-man talking~
'K::Keep it together, so there is a fish-man, so what?'
"NT::$Ehime:"
~Kent saw a man that looked almost exactly like him: except the part of his face that was missing. the remaining edges looking like a plastic figure too long in a microwave~
"A::You're supposed to be in a coma."
~A woman in a white captain's coat was standing at a desk to his right, her eyes trained on him~
*She walked up to him*
"A::Shit, Flanagan?"
"FL__F::No, over here."
*Felix walked in*
"K::You're Flanagan?"
"FL__F::As of 30 minutes ago, thanks for the heimlich - that would have been a short life other wise"
'K::Keep your mouth shut Kent.' 
~He did however keep a mental inventory of questions~
'K::Can they all hop bodies?
Coma - how do they know about the accident?
Why does that man look like me - what happened to him?
Is Felix dead now?'
"K::Where's Felix?"
"FL__F::He's right here, just in the back seat"
*Felix wandered over to a corner coffee desk and made himself some tea*
"FL__F::Also, hello Alacira, Gerald: I didn't think you were still around"
*Kent sat down on the couch across from Martha, and leaned in*
~He more mouthed the words than used his voice~
"K::Do you have my gun?"
~Martha hesitated, matching his volume~
"M::It's in a car upstairs."
*Kent gave a subtle nod*
"A::It is Kent, correct?"
*Again Kent nodded*
~More noticeably this time~
~This captain looked to Kent's double, then back to him~
"A::Interesting"
~A frail red head  woman sat cross legged at the edge of the table.
She chittered at a balding man in an ill-fitted uniform~
"G::How are things outside?"
"K::Not good."
'K::Why was she chittering?'
"FL__F::I've had time to think on what went wrong.
I think we grossly underestimated the amount of algera it had accumulated."
"A::We?"
"FL__F::I. If Martha gave an equal amount to everyone..."
'K::So Martha did this?'
~Kent watched Martha, and thought of Tom~
~Of the burns, of him in the hospital bed~
'K::What are you doing, Kent?'
~He couldn't get justice, nor would he settle for vengeance~
'K::If all it takes is a few words...'
"A::Not exactly everyone, just most"
"FL__F::And it was that much, that was probably the best way forward"
"G::What do you mean?"
"M::So it could have killed me."
~She said it to herself, Kent could hear, but flanagan went on~
"FL__F::Well, it's not accumulating that much Algera to do anything good.
Dispersing it means it will be harder to recollect."
"A::No, assholes will just funnel it to themselves.
That'll keep happening until there's a tight nit group that doesn't hate each other."
*Flanagan took a sip of his tea, and sat down*
"FL__F::Still, that will take time, and it's better than destroying that much Algera."
"A::What was your plan?"
"FL__F::Put the Algera in Martha over there."
*He pointed to Martha across the table*
"FL__F::She was hollowed out to about a week ago, she's in her mid-thirties."
"G::Do you know how much Algera that thing had?"
"FL__F::More or less, less than more it turns out."
"A::Orders of magnitude less I think"
~Kent sat quietly absorbing the conversation so far~
*Kent leaned his head back against the couch briefly*
~He nearly screamed. 
Above him in the rafters were two giant spiders.
They had a large web built already~
'K::No, no one else is freaked out'
~Martha caught his eye~
*She pointed to the ceiling, and gave a thumbs up*
'K::Okay, good spiders. 
How about you not look at the good spiders'
"FL__F::Martha, who is he?"
*Felix, Flanagan, whoever that was, pointed at him*
"A::Yeah, he's supposed to be in a coma"
"M::That's it?
Not even an apology you almost killed me?"
*Flanagan turn to her*
"FL__F::Yes, yes: sorry you almost died.
Your first death is the scariest."
*He gave a light cough*
"FL__F::The plan was to get back here use Uri...
Who's also dead now... 
Ozmind hasn't shown back up yet..."
~Kent glanced to see the captain in white cover a slight scoff~
"FL__F::My point is, What you did was right.
We would have poured all the excess Algera into the population eventually"
~When he looked back he saw Flanagan's eyes were both hard, wondering, and on him~
"FL__F::Now, Kent - how do you know Martha?"
~Kent took a moment, enclosed as he was he couldn't panic~
'K::What do you really want, Kent'
~He knew, and listening...
Seeing the fish-man, the spiders: he wasn't sure what was and wasn't possible anymore.
Restoration is what he wanted.
Tom back - and that seemed achievable now~
'K::Truth it is then'
"K::She killed a friend of mine, I'm trying to make that right"
"FL__F::Oh, and you can't bring him back?"
"K::She did it with her neighbor, new body - right?"
"M::You want me to bring him back?"
~Martha paused~
"FL__F::Felix is saying that was actually him, and Martha shouldn't be taking credit"
"M::I didn't say anything about that to him."
*Kent raised his hands pointing at himself*
"K::That's on me, That was Felix then?
I thought that was Martha."
"FL__F::He's also rudely insinuating you are a bad detective"
~Martha had been quite for a bit - she was listening off to her side: no one was sitting there~
"M::Did he have any friends, or family?"
"K::Me."
"M::Other than you?"
"K::I'm not sure actually, people that knew him, sure... but friends?"
"FL__F::Why other friends?"
~Martha paused~
"G::But of course, the Navigator is here"
"M::What?"
"G::The part of him that's in the Link - is the Navigator"
"A::That would mean that..."
~Alacira trailed off and spoke words that weren't words at him~
*Nothing happened*
"FL__F::Interesting - that's why you need other friends, we can't access the link through you"
"A::Wish I had known that before I parked..."
"G::Did you dream of a ship?"
"K::I don't dream"
~The response was automatic~
"K::No, wait, I did have a dream of a ship, earlier today."
"A::Good to know the ship is safe... probably."
*The Chemist jerked awake*
~Kent watched the expression of horror when the chemist looked up~
"C::Everyone else see the giant spiders"
*The chemist scanned the room*
"C::Where the hell am I?
Who are you?"
"A::And this is?"
"FL__F::A chemist, he got a hold of this."
~Flanagan held out the vial.
It darkly shimmered in the light~
"C::I didn't want to be awake, Felix."
"FL__F::I'm not actually Felix, but it wasn't us.
Everyone is awake."
*The chemist was staring at his hands*
~His eyes were wide, holding back terror and wonder~
"C::Everyone has this?"
*The chemist looked around the room again*
~His eyes landed on the fish-man~
"W::It's wilbert."
*Wilbert held out his hand*
~It was a fin attached to an arm, it reminded Kent of an folding fan~
*The chemist gingerly shook wilber's hand*
"FL__F::Apparently yes, everyone. now:"
*Flanagan leaned in*
"FL__F::Alice Glass made this.
I had a quick scroll through Felix's memories of the past few hours.
There was a kerfuffle and something like Alice was there.
It wasn't her. 
She spilled out this sludge when Felix took a bat to her chin.
She was about to kill Kent here at the time.
This here:"
*He walked over to his desk and placed the vial on top*
"FL__F::Uri told us this is what Al-tok is trying to produce en mass"
"K::What exactly is that?"
*Flanagan inspected the vial*
"FL__F::Exactly?
Only Alice could tell you that.
But more generally: it appears to be a required precursor to host Al-tok."
'K::Okay, if you had taken that syringe and you are immune to all of this, what would have happened?'
"M::So how does that help us?"
"FL__F::Not much, I'm afraid."
"C::I'm not hallucinating those spiders, am I?"
"G::They're quite friendly, once you get to know them"
"K::know them, they talk?"
~The redhead sitting on the floor started chittering at him.
Gerald a moment later started to translate~
"G::What, you don't think those giant prosomas are empty?/s"
"K::Also, what's up with her - she only speaks spider?"
"G::Yes. And she and the spiders are from a dream, nightmare actually"
"K::A Dream?"
*Gerald nodded*
"FL__F::We can all focus now, yes?"
~Flanagan cleared his throat with a hacking cough, and spoke quietly to himself~
"FL__F::Chew your damn food felix, you still have steak in your lungs."
~He addressed the room~
"FL__F::The Relux are on their way to getting The Way Out. 
All we need to do is wait, by tomorrow night - they should be back."
"K::All those people up there..."
~The people Kent saw were not even acting like people.
It was an apocalypse of the individual not to a wholistic entity, but many smaller fighting ones.
Entities structured exactly the same, one person was in control.
The whole processes reminded him of growing mold in a petri dish~
"K::Its feudalism."
~But they hadn't been actually hurting one another physically, there was no need that words became so powerful~
"K::But they weren't using guns. just words..."
"M::Words that would turn you into a mindless soulless automaton for some control freak"
"K::Yeah, but what can we do, against billions?"
"FL__F::A fair bit, actually."
*Flanagan gave a nod to Alacira*
"FL__F::You want to take point here, get started."
~Alacira's face lost it's scrunched up quality when she turned to Kent~
"A::What exactly did you see up there"
~He relayed incidences he saw.
A case where people were helping other's out of cars, only to be taken over by another group.
They had used phones, and had written on signs - strange symbols.
And another where two groups fought and merged~
~Flanagan, during this, had moved an old dial phone from some cabinet and connected it~
"A::Okay"
"FL__F::Got it?"
*Alacira nodded*
"K::Got what?"
*Flanagan held out the phone, then dialed on the base.
Alacira walked over and picked up the receiver*
"FL__F::She's got a namshub ready"
*He turned to Martha*
"K::Namshub?"
*She raised and shook her hand noncommittally*
"M::Spell?"
'K::Dealing with <i>not zombies</i>, cults, cardboard chemists.'
*Kent looked up*
'Spiders, from a dream...
A fish-man, who is rather quiet'
~Kent again heard not words coming from Alacira as she talked into the phone~
*He scanned the room*
~He heard words that were not words~
'K::Wizards...
what the hell is next?
Dragons - Cthulhu?'
*The Navigator put his hand on kent's shoulder*
`
'todo: add code bit here'
`
~A clarity pierced his hearing: burrowing to his brain~
*The navigator pulled his hand away*
~As he did that Kent felt a muteness, not of hearing but of mind~
~He remembered what he understood in that moment, but Alacira's voice returned to nonsense to him~
*Alacira put down the phone*
"A::Almost nothing to do now but wait."
"FL__F::Cheese anyone... brandy?"
*Flanagan walked into the next room leading to the kitchen*
~Kent watched the Navigator sit down across from him. 
It was unnerving: his attention on him~
"K::Almost?"
~Gerald and Alacira shared a look~
*Gerald pulled a small black hand mirror from his inside pocket*
"G::Once more into the fray."
~Gerald was holding the mirror out - toward Martha~
"M::How about you tell me what that's all about first, we have time now."
"G::Captain?"
~Alacira was standing next to the desk, focused on the vial of dark liquid on top~
*She absently waved her hand, and Gerald turned back*
"G::Right, so you've been gathering information, key..."
~Gerald fumbled for the right words~
"G::...components to a knowledge..."
~Again he hesitated~
"G::Bomb is close, but - remember how I said ideas can be dangerous in of themselves...
Well, when you start combining dangerous ideas together: you can make a weapon.
A weapon which is undefinable to humans, and renders things undefined."
"K::A knowledge bomb?"
"G::Just a label: a bad one at that."
"K::Undefined?"
"G::In other words, completely ignorable."
"M::You said this was the last one?"
*Gerald slowly nodded, and held out the mirror*
"M::What about the Way Out?"
"A::Two plans - better than one plan"
"FL__F::What cheeses?"
"G::All the cheeses, please"
"A::You trust his plans?"
~Martha waited, her eyes were on the Navigator, his face.~
"M::Where's this one go to?"
"G::Someplace dangerous, then dying mind of the first host of Al-tok - this time around."
"M::This time around?"
"A::Those monks in Italy, Kent here.
They all had contact with this entity."
"K::Wait - when did I have contact?"
"A::You're supposed to be in a coma - Al-tok is the reason why.
I took you, the part of you al-tok wanted on my ship..."
"N::$Ehime:"
'K::But that was not Al-tok, was it...
That was just depression.'
~Kent thought back to the days leading to the incident~
"M::Same deal? 
Something out of place?"
*Gerald nodded and Martha took the mirror and looked into it*
"A::Let's hope she doesn't screw us..."
*Alacira took a swig from a flask in her right pocket*
~Kent didn't have time to ask questions. 
He started to form the words when his left ear was deafened by Martha's scream~

mn:RX

{
~Ada was hunched by the door, bracing it closed~
~While it had a lock: we were not taking chances~
'L_R::If we wait maybe they will go away'
*Another knock*
~It was was followed by several attempts at turning the latch.
The knock itself was subdued, urgent, but not as loud as it could be.
Between each attempt was the small bright rattle of keys~
'AD_R::It sounds like it is just one out there'
'J_R::numbers in our favor...'
'RX::We let them in'
*Ada moved away, and unlocked the door*
~Silently we moved out of the line of sight~
~From behind the door Ada saw a short woman with long brown hair walk in~
*Ada closed the door*
*The stranger meeped and jump to the center of the room*
~She was holding a broken champagne glass stem as a makeshift brass-knuckle pointed at Ada.
In her other hand she held a set of keys~
"D::Who are you?"
~She held out the pointed glass stem at Ada, her hand was trembling~
"D::Don't move, just stay there."
"L_R::Easy now..."
*She spun toward Lenny*
"L_R::Why don't you tell us what's got you so worked up?"
*She spun toward Jochek, when she emerged from behind a book shelf*
"D::You're not?..."
~She took a moment to process~
"J_R::What's going on out there?"
*She lowered her hand*
~Not completely, she relaxed it in front of her~
"D::One person, the chef, seems to have gathering control of everyone downstairs"
"AD_R::The chef?"
"D::Da, I ran upstairs, this: the farthest down the hallway"
"AD_R::Why the chef?"
*She shrugged*
'AD_R::Everyone downstairs...'
'L_R::Means if anyone sees us...'
'J_R::We just take the stairs - they go down to the cellar.
But getting out...'
~There were no windows, no exits except for one~
'RX::We will have get everyone out of the foyer, the dinning room'
'J_R::Distraction?'
'L_R::Everyone - maybe a fire.'
'AD_R::Fire is not always the answer'
'RX::Although in this case...'
"D::Why are you staring at each-other?"
"AD_R::Just making plans, love.
If you would be so kind as to follow us?"
*Ada unlocked the door*
'AD_R::On this floor there is a lab'
~Ada led the way, down the hall, around a corner~
*Lenny rubbed his hands together*
'L_R::How well stocked? 
Pretty sure I could do a bit better than fire.'
'J_R::Well stocked, How long do you need?'
'L_R::You two grab the Way Out, 10 minutes maybe'
~A stainless steel door inlaid in the stone wall was the last to the left in the hallway~
*It opened with a woosh*
~Lenny and Jochek, still in the bodies of the coach driver and their fare, were blinded.
Ada however, could see the stainless steel coating every surface inside~
*Ada flipped a switch as Lenny stumbled inside*
~Inside the room a fain buzzing in the ceiling stopped, and the quality of light became softer, easier on the eyes~
"L_R::What was the chef doing?"
*Dana shrugged*
"D::I wasn't down there long."
*Jochek pointed at Lenny*
~Whom had already started pilfering the lab~
"J_R::Stay with him"
*Jochek grabbed Ada's hand and we led her away*
"L_R::Wait, take these."
*Lenny tossed them two gas masks hanging on the side wall*
'L_R::Shut the door, would you?'
*Ada did, finding a latch she also locked it*
'L_R::Maybe just the chef, if we take him out...'
~We had doubts if that would work, how far had the mind of the chef spread through the crowd~
*Lenny filled through the cupboards - taking inventory*
*Ada and Jochek walked down the hall*
'L_R::We can do an irritant, or... oh - will gas masks protect against that...'
~Lenny was looking at a vial labeled...~
'J_R::Nothing fancy Lenny.'
~They took a moment at the stairs, listening for activity~
~In the silence, Ada broke it with an old sharpened point~
'AD_R::One bad seed, Jochek'
'J_R::Do you know how long we vetted you?'
*They descended the stairs*
~A main set of stairs, and behind it - a smaller, more subdued set of stairs led to the floors below~
'L_R::This argument, again - let me concentrate'
'RX::We should add more to us'
'J_R::If we choose the right people'
~Jochek led the way - keeping a watch on the hallway entrance~
'AD_R::It only takes one'
~A few more floors down the cellar held the Way Out~
"D::Anything I can do to help?"
~Lenny, was lost in thought~
*He waved his hand at the open cupboards*
"L_R::Do we need the chef alive?"
'J_R::I doubt he has any knowledge of what happened'
'AD_R::If we can easily help it - you do have a whole lab there'
"D::Strictly speaking, I guess not"
'L_R::Chemistry is harder than you think'
"L_R::You know how much the chef weights?"
*Again, Dana Shrugged*
"D::I never actually saw him"
"L_R::Then how do you know he's doing anything?"
"D::People were going around saying - and I quote - 'in the name of the sioux chef supreme'"
'J_R::Someone has an ego'
*Ada flipped a switch in near the cellar door*
~Through iron bars in a half moon shape  hole in the door - a cramped hallway illuminated by orange sconces~
*Jochek tried the door* 
~it was locked~
"L_R:: The cellar door is locked."
"D::Da, as it is."
"L_R::...Is there a key?"
"D::The seneschal has it."
~Lenny waited~
"D::He's somewhere in that..."
~...that throng, well shit...~
'L_R::Can you break down the door?'
'AD_R::No, but I have a hairpin.'
*Jochek stretched out their hand expectantly*
~Ada might have nimbler hands, but her hearing was better too~
*Ada climbed the stairs, and stopped short at the sound of footsteps above*
'LX::How many is that?'
~About 20 Ada guessed~
*Lenny stopped what he was doing, and took out jugs of liquid on the table*
"L_R::Hey, go outside and make some noise - see if you can get their attention"
"D::Who's attention?"
"L_R::Downstairs, main floor, sounds  most of them"
*Lenny grabbed another tub of white powder off of the shelf*
*Dana opened the large metal door*
~It slid open with a hiss~
*Lenny tossed Dana a gas mask*
~A short time later, above her Ada heard~
"D::Hello, is anyone there!"
~Followed by footsteps up the stairs, followed by several more sets~
'A_R::Sounds a bit more than 20.'
*Lenny looked out the door, waiting, holding one vial above a vat*
~He was wearing a gas mask~
*Dana ran up the steps*
*Lenny pointed to his mask*
~Behind Dana were several dozen people, most perhaps in the castle~
~Lenny watched their shoes, their feet move, pointedly not looking at anything the storming crowd was holding~
~Lenny hummed tunes in his head, his current hearing was terrible and that helped, he didn't need it~
~He had our help, to forget, not that he needed it~
~Lenny waited for Dana to get her mask on, and then~
*He dropped the vial into the tub*
*An explosion of vapor, sticky and white clouded the room, then the hallway*
*Screams and coughs and cries sounded out as shadowed shapes hit the ground*
~The vapor expanded like a foam down the hall, down the stairs, flooding into the castle~
"L_R::Is the seneschal here, what does he look like?"
*Dana looked down through the fallen bodies, twisting and moaning, then she pointed*
"D::That one."
~And as Lenny inspected him he found a ring of keys... just as:~
'J_R::Got it.'
*The cellar door flung open*
~Stone walls, and wooden doors, unmarked~
'LX::Do we know which one?'
~Ada, our representative, was never down here~
~We did not know what else was down here~
~Lenny was wheezing through the mask, his old body not ready for such activity~
~He had to use the handrail down the stairs, and we let the potential carry his weight~
~Deep down, everyone was a potential to add to us~
