*Kent stuck out his hand*
~Keeping the lift doors from closing~
~Kent had the Chemist over one shoulder~
~The hospital bed would not fit in the elevator~
~Felix had said some 'not-words' to the dingy looking security guard~
*Felix entered and pressed some numbers on a keypad*
~They made their descent~
'K::Okay Kent, they think you are in the know.
Just keep calm - and bluff your ass off.'
*The lift opened*
~A hallway of dark wood, leading to a door with an alcove on the right~
*Felix lead the way*
"K::Why do you think this one hasn't woken up yet?"
*Felix paused then shrugged*
"FL__F::Chemistry?"
*Felix again pushed some buttons on a pin pad and the door opened*
~Kent followed into room seemingly designed to be as garish as possible~
"FL__F::To the right after the foyer, there are fainting couches, put him on"
*Kent moved to the other room*
~To find Martha, and a fish-man talking~
'K::Keep it together, so there is a fish-man, so what?'
"NT::$Ehime:"
~Kent saw a man that looked almost exactly like him~
~Besides part of his face missing~
~He was animatedly moving - grabbing Kent's attention~
"A::You're supposed to be in a coma."
~A woman in a white captain's coat walked up to him~
"A::Shit, Flanagan?"
"FL__F::No, over here."
~Kent turned to Felix~
"K::You're Flanagan?"
"FL__F::As of 30 minutes ago, thanks for the heimlich - that would have been a short life other wise"
'K::Keep your mouth shut Kent.' 
~He did however keep a mental inventory of questions~
'K::Can they all hop bodies?
Coma - how do they know about the accident?
Why does that man look like me - what happened to him?
Is Felix dead now?'
"K::Where's Felix?"
"FL__F::He's right here, just in the back seat"
*Felix wandered over to a corner coffee desk and made himself some tea*
"FL__F::Also, hello Alacira, Gerald: I didn't think you were still alive"
*Kent sat down on the couch across from Martha*
"K::Do you have my gun?"
~Martha hesitated~
"M::It's in a car upstairs."
*Kent nodded*
"A::It is Kent, correct?"
*Again Kent nodded*
~This captain looked to Kent's double, then back to him~
"A::Interesting"
~Sonny chittered at a balding man in an ill-fitted uniform~
"G::How are things outside"
"K::Not good"
'K::Why was she chittering?'
"FL__F::I've had time to think on what went wrong.
I think we grossly underestimated the amount of algera it had accumulated."
"A::We?"
"FL__F::I. If Martha gave an equal amount to everyone..."
"A::Not exactly everyone, just most"
"FL__F::And it was that much, that was probably the best way forward"
"G::What do you mean?"
"M::So it could have killed me."
~It was quiet, to herself~
"FL__F::Well, it's not accumulating that much Algera to do anything good.
Dispersing it means it will be harder to recollect."
"A::No, assholes will just funnel it to themselves.
That'll keep happening until there's a tight nit group that doesn't hate each other."
*Felix took a sip of his tea, and sat down*
"FL__F::Still, that will take time, and it's better than destroying that much Algera."
