## The undernet

#### A group created by [Flanagan](professor-flanagan.md), a honeypot on the internet for those intelligent enough to be awake.
#### it is used to occasionally pick out new people to awaken, but more it is to keep 'power-hungry mortals at bay'.
#### everything about the undernet was to hide the fact that [Flanagan](professor-flanagan.md) was recruiting from rejects... 
#### particularly only people that rejected the undernet instead of rejected from the undernet...
#### that was until [Flanagan](professor-flanagan.md) lost contact with his inside man, and a quick shadow fell over the group.
