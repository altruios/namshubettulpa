"M::So I'm basically crazy"
'R::No your reality is just a bit realigned'
"M::That's what crazy is!"
~And a moment later, and a bit quieter~
"M::I'm not crazy."
~Her hands felt sticky, they had been on her vest~
}
{
'R::Go ahead, push me out of the chair, and see for yourself'
~She did: not with any grace, or particular speed~
~But with a deep well of rage hidden deep below a murky still pond~
*He fell backwards, knocking his head against the wall*
~Leaving an indent in the plaster~
*The chair fell with him as he groped at his head*
*She used the opportunity to walk out of the side dining area through the backyard door*
~It felt real to her~
~Her vest, she didn't wear a vest at work~
}
{
*She walked out the door with two possibilities in her head*
`[*She had a nervous breakdown* => *Killed someone and imagined a surreal conversation*, 
~She was drugged and kidnapped by a crazed charlatan~,
~The was real~,
*She was in the link now*
]`
~She was acutely aware in a way she never was before about the structure of her own thoughts~
~As if she could feel a physical place where they fit in her brain~
~And just like that, as the bright moonlight hit her~
}
{
"M::Fuck, it's night."
~It was a bright light in the sky, but no - not the moon~
~It was a bubble, descending~
*She walked more determinedly*
~Forcing each foot to the ground as a stop-measure against her rising panic~
}
{
~She was in the backyard~
~A lush and wet lawn spanning what looked like an acre, surrounded by trees... 
She went around the corner as Rossin stepped out of the door behind her~
*He walked lazily down the steps, letting the door bang behind him*
~Martha remembered this before, a jolting deja vu~
"A::Reel her in!" 
~She felt a tugging on her vest~
~The rope behind her split into every fiber of her memory~
~A spiderweb, tugging at each edge, all encompassing her view~
~Pulling on each blade of grass, each part of her memory~
~The unique sensation of being ripped inside out~
~Martha found herself on the floor of the bubble~
*She took in a few breaths*
"M::Okay, the exit is up that way."

{
~Alacira was pulling the rope that led to martha's vest.~
"A::If we don't go through soon, she'll land right back in!"
"A::It's right below us, and catching up."    
*Martha looked down below*
~She saw herself, as herself, and from above~
~Though the above view was fading, as was her memory of Alacira, the moment she was out of view.~
}
{
~Martha went around the corner as Rossin stepped out of the door behind her~
*He walked lazily down the steps, letting the door bang behind him*
"M::You're following me now?"
*He shifted his tie, adjusted his hat now that it was on him*
'R::Well, I am in your head, you put two and two together.'
*Leaving him behind she walked past the side of the... mansion... yes it was a mansion*
~Complete with a ridiculously long driveway and hedges blocking all surrounding views~
*She continued out to the street, Rossin making his way behind her*
'R::There is more.'
*He paused once he caught up*
"M::I just pushed you out of a chair! 
You're real."
