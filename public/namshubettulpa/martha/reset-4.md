~He said nothing when they got past the hedges onto the street~
~Nor did he speak while on the pavement of the long narrow street with no lights~
~They walked in silence for a time~
~Each footfall kept her in the here and now~
~Determined not to think of where she was, or where she was going~
`['Just walking',
'One foot in front of the other, one step at a time.'
'Eventually things will pass.']`
~She heard her steps in sync with Rossin's~
~In the distance, a pale blue light rounded the corner of the street~

*Rossin covered his lips with a single finger, then his whole hand*
*And then he did a small skip and danced into the middle of the road*
~Just in time for the car, not having slowed down at all, to hit him~
*He folded under the hood and rolled underneath the tires*
*Martha count three and a half rolls*
*Some rational part of her brain managed to keep count*
*Pulling him down and under as the car hobbled over him*
*He rolled a few times on the pavement before laying motionless*
*The car drove into the distance*
*Martha rushed over into the middle of the street where his body lay*
*She tried to brush her hair out of her face, to tuck it behind her ear*
*She missed*
*Her hand was shaking*
~She never saw a car crash up close~
*A voice behind her called out, from where she had just been*
'R::Am I real?'
*Rossin, without a scratch on him, dusted off his sleeve*
'R::I really would like to know a definitive answer to that'
~She a double take: the body she had just been leaning over was gone~
'R::But you most probably are, so would you get out of the street.'
