      from: the meeting of the undernet,

    pragmatic reasons to keep the charade going - (he finds them).
    
    {TO USE}
    ~Everyone was in their own world, and trying to force everyone else to join them.
    But by pulling equally in all directions: commonalities appeared, ripples and echos of coherence.
    harmonizing waves in a sea of minds bound the desires of the outliers, often in persecution.~

# big notes:: 
  
  plot line threads to keep track of: 
    the way out needs to be added.
  
  A lot of this is old - and needs to be revamped.
