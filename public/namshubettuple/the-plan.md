# The Plan
{
*Ozmind discarded his teacup on the table*
"So any plan Flanagan?"
~Eyes turn toward him sitting across the parlor.~
~He looked each of them over in turn, his gaze landed on Felix.~
"Out: take a flight back to Fiji, we will be fine without you."
~Felix sputtered~
"What?"
"What comes next isn't for your ears"
*Martha looked around the room.*
~Everyone was looking at Uri Or Flanagan.~
~Felix looked at her~
'If I said something...'
~She did not.~
"Fine."
*Felix sat up and made his way to the exit*
"Call me if you need anything."
*Flanagan huffed.*
"You sure he's under control"
~Ozmind stiffened~
"Yeah - he's not thinking right now. let me just..."
*Flanagan nodded*
"And her?"
*His gaze fell to her*
*Rossin tapped her on the shoulder.*
"Tag me in."
~She did...~
~She was almost getting used to the sensation.~
*Her head nodded of Rossin's accord.*
~Martha saw the scene before her enveloped in shadow~
"She's fine to hear."
*Flanagan nodded and moved to the couch again.*
"Has he dealt with anything like this?"
~Martha asked and Rossin repeated.~
"Shadows of shadows... 
long ago..."
~Flanagan paused~
"If was contained, we could send it back, but in the link."
~Ozmind's voice cut in.~
"it hasn't shown any signs of slowing it's growth."
"So... how long do we have?"
~Martha asked.~
~Rossin looked at her, then back to Ozmind.~
"How long until it is everywhere in the link?"
"somewhere between days, not weeks... I really couldn't say."
