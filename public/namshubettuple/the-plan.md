# The Plan
{
mn:M
*Ozmind discarded his teacup on the table*
"O::Yes, security tapes."
"F::Okay."
"O::It's why Uri ran up to the mountains. If we the link was safe -"
"M::Wait, so why is the link dangerous?"
"FL::Before it was outside the link, our collective unconscious."
*Flanagan stood up, and walked to the window.*
'wait... the elevator went down.'
"FL::Before it needed us to execute namshubs."
~There was light across his face.~
"FL::Now it can run it's own..."
*Rossin was pacing back and forth.*
"F::So any plan Flanagan?"
~Eyes turn toward him sitting across the parlor.~
~He looked each of them over in turn, his gaze landed on Felix.~
"FL::Out: take a flight back to Fiji, we will be fine without you."
"F::What?"
"FL::What comes next isn't for your ears"
*Martha looked around the room.*
"R::Martha - I hate to do this so often... but can we switch?"
~She did...~
~She was almost getting used to the sensation.~
}
{
mn:R
~Everyone was looking at Uri Or Flanagan.~
"R::I would have a better solution."
*Ozmind huffed.*
"FL:: What do you have in mind."
*Martha in the shadowy realm walked to the windows.*
~It was just a bright light, she could tell there was, but could make nothing out.~
"M::Hey - can you walk over here: when you get the chance."
*Rossin, in her body, nodded at her.*
"R::Do you want to stay here Felix, and help us?"
*Felix looked around.*
~He met each of their eyes.~
"R::then be ready to listen."
~Felix narrowed his eyes.~
`
WITH hooks(
    M:=~Self~.~Memory~
    a:=set( ~Self~.temp_memory, M.New)
    b:=set( M.New, ( () |> ~Self~.NULL))
    add.([a,b]).release_on("Felix is a potato"){
        set(M.New, ~Self~.temp_memory)
        delete(~Self~.temp_memory)
    };
)
`
"R::There."
*Felix fell back on the sofa*
~He was wearing a constant expression of surprise.~
"R::He isn't forming new memories right now, it's like being asleep - but still conscious"
"M::So wait... that's like him constantly experience a bigger and bigger time gap?"
*Rossin moved her hand noncommittally*
"R::More or less."
"FL::Clever. If the link is not safe... neither would our sleep be."
"J::Our dreams?"
"R::Are what make up the link."
"M::Rossin, over here."
~Martha was still standing by the window.~
*Rossin got up, and moved to her*
~Martha heard Flanagan behind Rossin~
~But he became faded into shadow as Rossin, in her body, turned away from him.~
"FL::You sure he's under control"
~Ozmind stiffened~
"O::Yeah - he's not thinking right now. let me just..."
*Rossin and Martha looked out the window.*
~It was a hollow void of light - with no clear boundary on any horizon~
*Flanagan nodded*
"FL::And her?"
*His gaze fell to Rossin*
~And even though Rossin had her body still turned to Flanagan: he became more solid.~
~As if by his attention focused on them - made him more real.~
*Her head nodded of Rossin's accord.*
"R::She's fine to hear - quick study too."
~Martha saw the scene before her enveloped in shadow~
*Flanagan nodded and moved to the couch again.*
"M::Ask him if he has dealt with anything like this?"
~And Rossin repeated.~
"FL::Shadows of shadows... 
long ago..."
~Flanagan paused~
"FL::If was contained, we could send it back, but in the link."
~Ozmind's voice cut in.~
"O::It hasn't shown any signs of slowing it's growth."
"M::So... how long do we have?"
~Rossin looked at her, then back to Ozmind.~
"R::How long until it is everywhere in the link?"
"O::Somewhere between days, not weeks... I really couldn't say."
"FL::We're in a bit of a pickle then, if the Relux..."
"J::What about us?"
"FL::Is miss Lovelace still in the compound"
"L::She is heading back to us now, as requested."
"FL::Give her a call:"
"L::We don't call - "
"FL::We need to tell her to wait."
*Lenny and Jochek exchanged a look.*
"FL::We're meeting her there, make the call."
*Lenny pulled out a cell phone and made the call.*
~Felix's continued gasping of surprise counterpointed the cellphone's ring.~
"L::Stay."
*He hung up and looked at Flanagan.*
"FL::Most of the people who would take advantage of that open line would be dead now, or otherwise now in disorder."
*Jochek shrugged.*
"R::What's the plan?"
*Rossin turned away from the window.*
~The dog was laying in the light, basking in it's warmth~
~Unconcerned for it's origin.~
"FL::3 parts... 
First we have to think of this as a viral infection."
*Flanagan stood up and paced the room*
"FL::Ozmind, do you know Alice's formula?"
"O::I don't... Uri might - but I don't think so. 
I might be able to find it at her lab... 
but she... it, might still be there."
"FL::Go and find it, if you find them - report back instead. You'll take Felix."
~Flanagan sighed~
"FL::The separated Relux will join the third and steal The way out."
"M::The way out?"
*Rossin raised his hand in a wait and listen sort of way*
"FL::Ozmind and Felix will search for the physical presence.
The Relux will bring the thing to exorcise the physical presence.
In the mean time We can't save the people injected..."
"R::What about the link - do you have an answer for that?"
"FL::One step at a time"
~There was a pause.~
"FL::I have ideas - but none of them are a sure thing."
"J::What's your best one?"
"FL::Best how?"
~Flanagan had a toothy grin.~
"FL::highest chance of success or highest chance of survival?"
"R::Success"
*Flanagan sipped his tea.*
"FL::It is intelligent, it would spread itself out, as much as it could."
"J::If we gathered them in one place."
"L::Then we could use something smaller."
"O::Why would it gather?"
"FL::More accurately: what exactly is it planning"
~Eyes fell on Flanagan.~
"FL::It doesn't seem that interested in the general population, however 2/3rds..."
"L::It's targeting the Awakened: because we can fight back?"
"FL::That would be likely... 
it gets worse...
By removing 2/3rds of the Awakened..."
*Flanagan rubbed his face*
"FL::I think I know what it's next steps are."
~Flanagan looked at Rossin in Martha's body.~
"FL::And how to counter it."
*Flanagan sipped more tea.*
"FL::She is new?"
"R::Rossin?"
"M::What's going on?"
"FL::New and empty?"
"R::Yes, We also have Uri over here."
"FL::We'll need both, He's mostly full anyway."
"M::Rossin, what's going on?"
*She flipped the switch*
}
{
mn:M
"M::Need me for what?"
"FL::For your inexperience, my dear, and your previous lack of novelty."
'...What?'
~Martha was pretty sure that was a subtle diss.~
"M::I was a boring person you mean?"
"FL::Ready to be soaked up - full of Algera."
"M::What exactly is Algera?"
"FL::not until the dump."
*Martha tilted her head.*
"FL::info dump."
"M::Okay - so you need me to learn a bunch of things: and that will help us... 
How?"
"FL::So it won't be new anymore."
"M::I'm a bit lost."
"FL::That's the point of it, my dear - don't worry, it won't kill you...
probably."
~Flanagan addressed the whole room.~
"FL::Fly quickly - return here, Rossin: wake Felix."
`"Why couldn't Felix be... awake for this?"`
"R::Would you mind saying Felix is a potato?"
}
{
~She repeated the words and Felix started.~
"F::You all moved."
"O::Come on, We are doing some recon."
"M::Where do I go?"
"FL::Downward, into the library"
