# The Plan
{
mn:M
*Uir discarded his teacup on the table*
"O__U::Uri saw the security feed, as it was happening"
"F::Okay."
~Felix leaned back, mostly satisfied with his query~
"O__U::It's why Uri ran up to the mountains. If the link were safe -"
"M::Wait, why is the link dangerous?"
"FL::Before it was outside the link, our collective unconscious."
*Flanagan stood up, and walked to the window*
'Wait... the elevator went down, and we were below ground in the garage'
~Martha looked closer at the window~
"FL::Before it needed us to execute namshubs."
~There was light across his face~
"FL::Now it can run its own..."
*Rossin was pacing back and forth*
"F::So any plan Flanagan?"
~Eyes turn toward him sitting across the parlor~
~He looked each of them over in turn, his gaze landed on Felix~
"FL::Out: take a flight back to Fiji, we will be fine without you."
"F::What?"
"FL::What comes next isn't for your ears"
*Martha looked around the room*
'R::Martha - I hate to do this so often... but can we switch?'
~She did~
~She was almost getting used to the sensation~
}
{
mn:R
~Everyone was looking at Uri or Flanagan~
"R::I would have a better solution."
*Uri huffed*
"FL:: What do you have in mind."
*Martha in the shadowy realm walked to the windows*
~It was just a bright light, she could tell there was space out there, but could make nothing out~
*She looked out the window*
~It was void - filled with bright light~
~In the distance she saw shadows - the same shadows behind her~
'M::Hey - can you walk over here: when you get the chance.'
*Rossin, in her body, nodded at her*
"R::Do you want to stay here Felix, and help us?"
*Felix looked around*
~He met each of their eyes~
"R::then be ready to listen."
~Felix narrowed his eyes~
`
WITH hooks(
    M:=~Self~~Memory~
    a:=set( ~Self~.temp_memory, M.New)
    b:=set( M.New, ()=>~serenity~ |> ~Self~.NULL)
    add.([a,b]).release_on("Felix is a potato", ()=>{
        a:=set(M.New, ~Self~.temp_memory)
        b:delete(~Self~.temp_memory)
        add.([a,b]).release()
    });
)
`
"R::There."
*Felix fell back on the sofa*
~He was wearing an expression of surprise~
~His expression soured somewhat, it was both constantly astonished~
~And serene to that astoundment~
"R::He isn't forming new memories right now, it's like being asleep - but still conscious"
'M::So wait... that is like him constantly experience a bigger and bigger time gap?'
*Rossin moved her hand noncommittally*
"R::More or less - he feels perfectly serene."
"FL::Clever. If the link is not safe... neither would our sleep be."
"J::Our dreams?"
"R::Are what make up the link."
'M::Rossin, come over here'
~Martha was still standing by the window~
*Rossin got up, and moved to her*
~Martha heard Flanagan behind Rossin~
~But he became faded into shadow as Rossin, in her body, turned away from him~
"FL::You sure he's under control"
~Ozmind stiffened~
"O__U::Yeah - he's not thinking right now. 
Let me just..."
*Rossin and Martha looked out the window*
~It was a hollow void of light - with no clear boundary on any horizon~
~Emanating a blanket's security, and comfortable warmth~
*Flanagan nodded*
"FL::And her?"
*His gaze fell to Rossin's Back*
}
{
~And though Rossin had her body turned away from him: Flanagan became more solid~
~His outline sharpened and he became brighter~
~As if by his attention focused on them - made him more real~
*Her head nodded of Rossin's accord*
"R::She's fine to hear - quick study too."
*Flanagan nodded and moved to the couch again*
'M::Ask him if he has dealt with anything like this?'
~And Rossin repeated~
"FL::Shadows of shadows... 
Long ago..."
~Flanagan paused~
"FL::If it was contained, we could send it back, but since it's in the link now"
~Ozmind's voice cut in~
"O__U::It hasn't shown any signs of slowing it's growth."
'M::So: how long do we have?'
~Rossin looked at her, then back to Ozmind~
"R::How long until it is everywhere in the link?"
"O__U::Somewhere between days, not weeks... I really couldn't say."
"FL::We're in a bit of a pickle then, if the Relux..."
"J::What about us?"
"FL::Is miss Lovelace still in Șolomanță?"
"L::She is heading back to us now, as requested."
"FL::Give her a call:"
"L::We don't call Scholomance - "
"FL::We need to tell her to wait."
*Lenny and Jochek exchanged a look*
"FL::We're meeting her there, make the call."
*Lenny pulled out a cell phone and stepped into the other room to make the call*
~Felix's continued gasping of surprised serenity counterpointed the cellphone's ring~
"FL::Most of the people who would take advantage of that open line would be dead now, or otherwise now in disorder."
*Jochek shrugged*
"R::What's the plan?"
*Rossin turned away from the window*
~The dog was laying in the light, basking in it's warmth~
~Unconcerned for it's origin~
"FL::3 parts... 
First we have to think of this as a viral infection."
*Flanagan stood up and paced the room*
"FL::Ozmind, do you know Alice's formula?"
"O__U::I don't... Uri might - but I don't think so. 
I might be able to find it at her lab... 
but she... it, might still be there."
"FL::Go and find it, if you find them - report back instead. You'll take Felix."
~Flanagan sighed~
"FL::The separated Relux will join the third and steal The way out."
'M::The way out?'
*Rossin raised his hand in a wait and listen sort of way*
"FL::Ozmind and Felix will search for the physical presence.
The Relux will bring the thing to exorcise the physical presence.
In the mean time we can't save the people injected..."
"R::What about the link - do you have an answer for that?"
"FL::One step at a time"
~There was a pause~
"FL::I have ideas - but none of them are a sure thing."
"J::What's your best one?"
"FL::Best how?"
~Flanagan had a toothy grin~
"FL::highest chance of success or highest chance of survival?"
"R::Success"
*Flanagan sipped his tea*
"FL::Containment, reduction, expulsion...
Containment would be hard: it is intelligent, it would spread itself out, as much as it could."
*Lenny walked back in and sat down*
"J::If we gathered them in one place."
"L::Then we could use something like a bomb - blow it to pieces all at once."
"O__U::Why would it gather?"
"FL::Consider it hasn't attacked us all directly through the link yet, what exactly is it planning?"
~Eyes fell on Flanagan~
"FL::It doesn't seem that interested in the general population, however 2/3rds..."
"L::It's targeting the Awakened: because we can fight back?"
"FL::You say this serum is required for the host to survive."
~Ozmind, in Uri's body nodded~
"FL::It took about 2 weeks from this thing's arrival until it took two thirds of us.
I assume its focused on spreading as fast as it can - so that gives us some estimate"
"R::First the Awakened, then the population"
"FL::That would be likely... 
it gets worse...
By removing 2/3rds of the Awakened..."
*Flanagan rubbed his face*
"FL::I think I know what it's next steps are."
~Flanagan looked at Rossin in Martha's body~
"FL::And how to counter it."
*Flanagan sipped more tea*
"FL::She is new?"
'M::What is going on?'
"FL::New and empty?"
"R::Yes, We also have Uri over here we can hollow out."
"FL::We'll need both."
'M::Rossin, what is  happening?'
~Instincts of predators hiding in the brush~
*She flipped the switch*
}
{
mn:M
"M::Need me for what?"
"FL::For your inexperience, my dear, and your previous lack of novelty."
'...What?'
~Martha was pretty sure that was a subtle diss~
"M::I was a boring person you mean?"
"FL::Ready to be soaked up - full of Algera."
"M::What exactly is Algera?"
"FL::Not until the dump."
*Martha tilted her head*
"FL::The info dump."
`'is he fucking with me?'`
*Rossin shook his head*
"M::Okay - so you need me to learn a bunch of things: and that will help us... 
How?"
"FL::So it won't be new anymore."
'M::He is fucking with me'
"M::I'm a bit lost."
"FL::That's the point of it, my dear - don't worry, it won't kill you...
probably."
~Flanagan addressed the whole room~
"FL::Fly quickly - return here. 
Rossin: wake Felix."
`"Why couldn't Felix be awake for this?"`
'R::Most people should not know about The way out.
Most people: most awakened*...
Also would you mind telling Felix that he is a potato so he wakes up?'
}
{
~She repeated the words and Felix's ability to make memories was restored~
"F::You all moved."
"O__U::Come on, We are doing some recon."
"F::Recon, what's going on?"
"O__U::Walk and talk: time to go."
"M::Where do I go?"
"FL::Downward, into the library"
*Flanagan pointed with the cane we was leaning on*
~Pointed to a small door to the right, besides a fireplace~
~It lead to a spiral stairwell and they descended, Flanagan trailing behind~
}

}
{
~Kent watched the syringes brought to the center of the room~
"AG_T::We have only this much made today."
"RG_T::Getting production up to scale takes some time."
~In the corner the man with the shaven head watched~
~Kent kept him in the corner of his eye~
~As he watched the circle of people he realized something~
'I am at the right hand side'
~despite it's circular nature Kent sensed the head of this gathering~
'From the entrances and exits - seats watching everything creating a power imbalance'
~And kent watched that man in the corner~
~That man was scanning the room, interested in the others more than kent~
"RG_T::Real power - chemically accessed"
'Okay - bad ideas out of the way - probably should not run'
'Even if you get a hold of that syringe'
'Event if there is a good escape'
'Just get out of here quietly'
"O_T::Take it - and you will have unlimited power"
"RG_T::Power of your dreams and beyond"
"AG_T::We only have three today"
~The small group of about 20 wondered only shortly how they would be rationed~
"RG_T::Everyone's going to get one - so lottery doesn't make sense.
We'll start to my right."
}
{
*Kent clenched stomach*
'Okay: you have permission to run'
'Especially if you can grab that syringe'
'They are looking at you, deer caught in the headlights'
~Kent considered the fact he was immune, and no one out on the street was~
*Kent reached out his hand*
"K::I'll do the honors"
*Kent rolled his neck*
"K::Arm, neck, or anywhere?"
*Alice handed him a syringe*
*He passed it down to his left*
'Stall tactic - keep going'
*Alice handed him another*
*And then the third once he passed that down*
~The second person sitting to his left held the syringe inspecting it~
*The man to his left stabbing it into his own upper thigh*
*The second man to his left bolted upright, and then scrambled out one entrance*
~The entrance opposite to the way Kent entered~
*Kent did the same, running towards the way he came in*
~Kent heard words that weren't words and then a loud thud~
~He didn't look back~
*He ran down the hallway to the exit*
~It wasn't until he made it to front door that he heard scrambling from inside~
}
{
~He made it to the corner of the alley of the street before he headed the metal door open behind him~
*He turned to look as he rounded the corder*
~At the hallway entrance was that woman in the red cardigan~
~He knew she saw him make a right~
'Okay, relax  - think'
~He kept running with the sun in his eyes~
*He undid his jacket, and his empty gun holster*
*He rounded a corner and took them off*
~He took a moment to catch his breath~
*He dropped the empty jacket down in the corner*
*He balled the holster in his fists*
}
{
'Okay, timing and finesse - you got this'
~He waited for her to round the corner~
*He faced away from where she would round the corner*
~Running steps approached~
*Kent Walked backwards*
*He had her back to her, waving at someone*
~Alice had not turned yet~
~He watched her scan the crowd - continuing his backward walk~
*Kent tossed the gun-strap on the other side of the corner*
*He then continued crossing the street, towards central park*
~He saw her spot the jacket~
*He turned around and faced the park*
~He couldn't see her, but neither could she see his face~
~He was halfway though the street before he heard a muttering~
~A horn honked in his ear - and yet: he still heard her quite voice~
'Okay,what is she doing?'
~Kent watched everyone - and was almost prepared for the sudden stop~
*He stopped*
}
{
~He forced his breath to be as regular as he could muster~
'Red-light green-light bullshit'
~He felt her gaze fall over him, and slip away~
~When nothing was moving but one thing - it was much easier to hear~
'Those words again'
~No sooner had he registered them he realized everyone was turning toward her~
~He did likewise~
*He stared at her stone faced*
~He had the syringe palmed in his hand still~
~She scanned the crowd and her gaze never halted on him~
*She wandered in a wide arc, before settling to backtracking*
~He watched from across the street her run away from him~
~Everyone around him, including the cars came back to life suddenly~
~He did the same~
'They just let me go, with this syringe?'
~He was cupping it so he wouldn't stab himself accidentally~
~But he'd just as soon rather not have it~
*Kent walked to and sat down on a bench*
"F::So was it her or wasn't it?"
"U::It felt like her"
~Kent watched two men hurriedly run toward the intersection he was at~
*He got up and walked a short distance behind them*
~Close enough to hear~
"U::Her lab is across town"
"F::Undernet is right here, that's where they're at Ozmind"
*Kent ducked between two parked cars*
'are they going to meet?'
"F::We should head to the lab if it's empty"
"U::Empty of Alice, maybe more, but by now - we can't be sure"
~They walked toward the alley he came out of~
*Kent stopped at the entrance for the alley and looked in*
~Felix was leaned against the wall, and the other one was opening the door~
*The door opened and that shaven man was in the hallway*
~Kent could hear words that weren't words~
*The man at the door crumpled*
~Kent wavered if he should help~
*The shaven man stepped out into the light*
*Felix swung a pipe into the man's head*
~A few more pipes behind Felix scattered to the ground~
*The man staggard and fell*
~An ichor poured out of the wound~
~Not blood: but something richer - thicker~
~A color that was unnatural~
~It was both black, and every color - or more a color that didn't exist~
~A chemistry that didn't exist~
*It sizzled in the afternoon sun*
~It was on the concrete - and parts sprayed into the man that opened the door~
*It sizzled on Uri's face*
~Both Uri and the shaven head man were motionless on the ground~
*Felix stumbled forward out to the mouth of the alley*
~In front of Kent his vision was blocked by a red cardigan~
*Kent looked up*
*Alice strolled toward Felix*
~Kent heard words - that were not words~
*Felix stumbled to the ground*
~Kent held the syringe in his hand considering what to do~
'He was a bastard'
*Kent put the syringe down*
'But that.'
~And there was a sudden moment of clarity~
*He looked down at the syringe*
'This stuff, that ooze, the dead...'
~He couldn't finish the thought~
'All connected'
~He knew now he would see the same impossible color ichor from her~
~Felix was still on the ground, unmoving~
'Is he dead?'
*Felix gasped*
'Alright, here comes the calvary, ass-hat'
~Kent left the syringe in the crook of the sidewalk and street~
'If he arrested her...'
'No one would believe me, and she would make them not believe me'
*He picked up a small two by four*
~He did not like what he knew he must do~
'You could run'
*As Kent crept closer he looked between her and the black ichor*
~It was still sizzling, he didn't think it would stop~
"AG_T::I wouldn't speak if I were you."
*She look to the left, down at the bodies*
*Kent glided to the right*
~Closing the distance~
*He swung*
*She dodged and spun*
~Her face was scrunched into a snarl of curiosity~
"AG_T::Why can't I feel you?"
*He swung again*
*She moved up to him*
~Nearly hugging him~
*She curled into his throw and twisted the board out of his hand*
*She also tripped him*
*Kent panicked and failed wildly*
~He felt fabric and tried to take her down with him~
~He did not~
"AG_T::I can hear you, but..."
~Kent saw Felix on his feet~
'The hell is he doing with his mouth'
~Kent watched Felix some more while pretending to be more stunned than he was~
'Oh, he wants me to make loud noises?'
'Keep her attention?'
~She tilted her head at his singing~
"K::OH SAY CAN YOU SEE?"
*She leaned over him*
"K::BY THE DAWSON GREEN LIFE"
"AG_T::Those aren't the words"
"K::STAY TRUE, THROUGH THE RUSE"
~Kent heard the sudden wack against her head and flinched~
*Alice fell to his left, he rolled to his right*
~Kent looked himself over - making sure of no contamination~
~A young man stopped around the center of the mouth to the alley~
"SM::What you guys doing in - oh my lord - somebody call the police"
*He backed away, and ran*
"K::I am the police"
~He did not stop~
"SM::Someone call the gangs, the police are here."
~There was a moment of silence~
"K::There's more of them inside"
*Felix started running out the alley*
*Kent followed*
"K::Hey, I got some questions for you."
*Felix turned and mimed to his mouth*
'K::Fucking convenient'
~Kent chased after~
