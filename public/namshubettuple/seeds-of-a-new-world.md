~Kent did not dream~
~He never did~
*He woke up*
~Around him was a heavy silence, what sounded like static in the distance~
"K::Too early, no alarm"
*He jolted up from the hospital bed*
~The walls around him were partial board, makeshift~
'K::Shit... where are you, Kent?'
*There was a single knock at the door to his left*
~More of a slam really, a moment later it came again~
~Kent's head throbbed - pulsing in rhythm to the darkness receding from his vision~
*Another slam on the door*
"K::Hello?"
~Silence and then~
*Another slam*
~It was then Kent noticed the leg sticking partway into the room~
*Kent rushed to the door*
~His clothes were still on, though there was a hospital gown below his bed that seem to have been dropped~
~He found a woman on the floor, having some sort of seizure~
*Her leg jerked into the door again*
*Kent looked both ways down the hallway she was in*
~All was silent - but down to the left there was another person on the floor~
'K::Right, fucking cardboard palace - chemistry... 
Should you be breathing though a filter?'
~The air seemed fine~
"K::Hello?"
~He was calling into a void~
*He felt at her pulse*
~It was steady, and her breathing seemed fine~
'K::The fuck is happening?'
*Kent rushed over to the other person down the hall*
~They too were stable~
~Kent was in an abandon building~ 
~He supposed he must not have been moved far~
'K::Is this the lab?'
*Kent wandered down the hall*
~It reminded him more of a hospital, the floors were linoleum~
~But the walls were bare wood - free floating~
~Unconnected to the hallway walls; And distant fluorescent lines flickered along a dark ceiling~
~There were no signs for exits, nothing was 'up to code'~
~There were others lying on the ground - all in the same condition~
~In the distance he heard a sound~
~A sort of static that grew to a high pitched whine: the sound of a CRT TV~
*He walked toward that sound*
~He eventually made out a voice~
"RP::If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down"
"K::Hello?"
"RP::Stop what you are doing and lie down, we don't-"
~They Stopped talking~
"SM::This is a recorded message"
*Kent opened the door*
~The room was an office, and had a CRT TV cradled in a boom arm sticking out of the wall~
~A channel logo was playing, then suddenly the reporter came back on~
"RP::Some sort of illness is striking millions of people every minute causing seizures.
This illness is everywhere, and we don't know how it spreads, but on the street - people keep falling.
This is happening everywhere - put down any sharp objects and lie down.
If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down.
Stop what your doing and lie down, we don't-"
~The reporter's face twitched violently to the side and they let out what looked like a silent scream~
*The reporter fell*
*She was caught by some arms racing in from off camera*
~The screen turned back into the logo~
"SM::This is a recorded message."
*The TV continued to loop*
"K::Did that happen to me, I fell asleep right?"
*Kent felt at himself*
~He felt fine~
"K::Hello!"
'K::Okay kent, what to do, what to do'
*His stomach growled*
'K::Food soon, should start crawling - maybe carry a pillow'
~He wondered if he could find some tape~
~Then he thought of what he would find outside~
*Kent kneeled down and started crawling*
'K::Better safe than sorry'
~Either way Kent had to see outside~
~It was so quite~
'K::Where did Felix go, or the chemist'
~Kent ran through his options:~
~Finding Felix in a place this large while crawling would be less than ideal~
~He didn't know where the exits were anyway~
'K::You could have a seizure at any moment'
"K::How long had that been playing"
'K::Maybe it was in a loop for hours'
~He sat there and considered how long he could have been out for~
~There were no clocks on the bare wood walls~
~He waited, listening: nothing happened for several long minutes~
*He stood up, and walked on*

`{rough outline:
    Reference to deal made in interludes 2 with robert glass.
    Alacira chastises Martha for her actions of waking everyone up. -
        "You know enough to be dangerous. 
        Do you know why most people are kept ignorant, asleep? 
        So they don't do stupid shit like that.
        Knowledge itself is dangerous. 
        The powers of creation in the mind of a toddler - that is what you did!
        You gave everyone a gun glued to their foot - or worse"
    the dreadnought is attacked
    Martha does something clever but first order thinking only
