~Kent did not dream~
~He never did~
*He woke up*
~Around him was a heavy silence, what sounded like static in the distance~
"K::Too early, no alarm"
*He jolted up from the hospital bed*
~The walls around him were partial board, makeshift~
'K::Shit... where am I?'
*There was a single knock at the door*
~More of a slam really, a moment later it came again~
~Kent's head throbbed - pulsing in rhythm to the darkness receding from his vision~
*Another slam on the door*
"K::Hello?"
~Silence and then~
*Another slam*
~It was then Kent noticed the leg sticking partway into the room~
*Kent rushed to the door*
~His clothes were still on, though there was a hospital gown below his bed that seem to have been dropped~
~He found a woman on the floor, having some sort of seizure~
*Her leg jerked into the door again*
*Kent looked both ways down the hallway she was in*
~All was silent - but down to the left there was another person on the floor~
'K::Chemistry... 
Should I be breathing though a filter?'
~The air seemed fine~
"K::Hello?"
~He was calling into a void~
*He felt at her pulse*
~It was steady, and her breathing seemed fine~
'K::The fuck is happening?'
*Kent rushed over to the other person down the hall*
~They to were stable~
~Kent was in an abandon building~ 
~He supposed he must not have been moved far~
*Kent wandered down the hall*
~There were no signs for exits, nothing was 'up to code'~
~There were others - they were all in the same condition~
~In the distance he heard a sound~
~A sort of static that grew to a high pitched whine~
~The sound of a CRT TV~
*He walked toward that sound*
~He eventually made out a voice~
"RP::If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down"
"K::Hello?"
"RP::Stop what you are doing and lie down, we don't-"
~They Stopped talking~
"SM::This is a recorded message"
*Kent opened the door*
~The room was an office, and had a CRT TV cradled in a boom arm sticking out of the wall~
~A channel logo was playing, then suddenly the reporter came back on~
"RP::Some sort of illness is striking millions of people every minute causing seizures.
This illness is everywhere, and we don't know how it spreads, but on the street - people keep falling.
This is happening everywhere - put down any sharp objects and lie down.
If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down.
Stop what your doing and lie down, we don't-"
~The reporter's face twitched violently to the side and they let out what looked like a silent scream~
*The reporter fell*
*She was caught by some arms racing in from off camera*
~The screen turned back into the logo~
"SM::This is a recorded message."
