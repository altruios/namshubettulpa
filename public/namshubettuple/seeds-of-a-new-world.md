~Kent did not dream~
~He never did~
*He woke up*
~Around him was a heavy silence, what sounded like static in the distance~
"K::Too early, no alarm"
*He jolted up from the hospital bed*
~The walls around him were partical board, makeshift~
'K::Shit... where am I?'
*There was a single knock at the door*
~More of a slam really, a moment later it came again~
~Kent's head throbbed - pusling in rhythm to the darkness recedding from his vision~
*Another slam on the door*
"K::Hello?"
~Silence and then~
*Another slam*
~It was then Kent noticed the leg sticking partway into the room~
*Kent rushed to the door*
~His clothes were still on, though there was a hospital gown below his bed that seem to have been dropped~
~He found a woman on the floor, having some sort of seizure~
*Her leg jerked into the door again*
*Kent looked both ways down the hallway she was in*
~All was silent - but down to the left there was another person on the floor~
'K::Chemistry... 
Should I be breathing though a filter?'
