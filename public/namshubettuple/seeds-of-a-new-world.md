~Kent did not dream~
~He never did~
*He woke up*
~Around him was a heavy silence, what sounded like static in the distance~
~He was on a bed~
'K::Too early, no alarm'
~He had his clothes on still - as if someone had just tossed him there~
~He saw distance fluorescent tubes, and a ceiling of empty darkness~
*He jolted up from the hospital bed*
~The walls around him were particle board, makeshift~
~The top of the wall did not reach the ceiling~
~The gap was ten... fifteen meters or more~
'K::Shit... where are you, Kent?'
*There was a single knock at the open door to his left*
~More of a slam really, a moment later it came again~
~Kent's head throbbed - pulsing in rhythm to the darkness receding from his vision~
*Another slam on the door*
"K::Hello?"
~Silence and then~
*Another slam*
~It was then Kent noticed the leg sticking partway into the room~
*Kent rushed to the door*
*He nearly slipped on a hospital gown by the bed*
~He found a woman on the floor, having some sort of seizure~
*Her leg jerked into the door again*
*Kent looked both ways down the hallway she was in*
~All was silent - but down to the left there was another person on the floor~
'K::Right, fucking cardboard palace - chemistry... 
Should you be breathing though a filter?'
~The air seemed fine~
"K::Hello?"
~He was calling into a void~
*He felt at her pulse*
~It was steady, and her breathing seemed fine~
'K::The fuck is happening?'
*Kent rushed over to the other person down the hall*
~They too were stable~
~Kent was in an abandon building~ 
~He supposed he must not have been moved far~
'K::Is this the lab?'
*Kent wandered down the hall*
~It reminded him more of a hospital, the floors were linoleum~
~But the walls were bare wood - free floating~
~Unconnected to the hallway walls; And distant fluorescent lines flickered along a dark ceiling~
~There were no signs for exits, nothing was 'up to code'~
~There were others lying on the ground - all in the same condition~
~In the distance he heard a sound~
~A sort of static that grew to a high pitched whine: the sound of a CRT TV~
*He walked toward that sound*
~He eventually made out a voice~
"RP::If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down"
"K::Hello?"
"RP::Stop what you are doing and lie down, we don't-"
~They Stopped talking~
"SM::This is a recorded message"
*Kent opened the door*
~The room was an office, and had a CRT TV cradled in a boom arm sticking out of the wall~
~A channel logo was playing, then suddenly the reporter came back on~
"RP::Some sort of illness is striking millions of people every minute causing seizures.
This illness is everywhere, and we don't know how it spreads, but on the street - people keep falling.
This is happening everywhere - put down any sharp objects and lie down.
If you are driving, stop driving, turn off your car and lie down.
Stop what your doing and lie down, we don't-"
~The reporter's face twitched violently to the side and they let out what looked like a silent scream~
*The reporter fell*
*She was caught by some arms racing in from off camera*
~The screen turned back into the logo~
"SM::This is a recorded message."
*The TV continued to loop*
"K::Did that happen to me, I fell asleep right?"
*Kent felt at himself*
~He felt fine~
"K::Hello!"
'K::Okay Kent, what to do, what to do'
*His stomach growled*
'K::Food soon, should start crawling - maybe carry a pillow'
~He wondered if he could find some tape~
~Then he thought of what he would find outside~
*Kent kneeled down and started crawling*
'K::Better safe than sorry'
~Either way Kent had to see outside~
~It was so quite~
'K::Where did Felix go, or the chemist'
~Kent ran through his options:~
~Finding Felix in a place this large while crawling would be less than ideal~
~He didn't know where the exits were anyway~
'K::You could have a seizure at any moment'
"K::How long had that been playing"
'K::Maybe it was in a loop for hours'
~He sat there and considered how long he could have been out for~
~There were no clocks on the bare wood walls~
~He waited, listening: nothing happened for several long minutes~
'K::Okay... What could be up'
"K::You got everyone doing a thing besides you... 
This is just a mass hypnosis thing... 
Again...
This isn't a virus outbreak..."
'K::How much sleep did you actually get?'
~Kent felt like he should have realized that earlier~
~Regardless of the adrenaline, his mind was still groggy~
*He stood up, and walked on*
~Felix wasn't hard to find, nor the Chemist: they were right next to each other~
~Had he gone out the room he was in the other way, he would have found them right there around a corner~
~After a brief inspection he found that both the bed would fit though the door, and was on wheels~
~It was wide enough for two... with some imagination, and using the guard rails~
"K::right, vial"
~Kent found it rolled next to where the chemist had been - thankfully intact~
'K::Time to go outside'
~With Felix and the Chemist in tow, Kent found his way out of the building~
~And into a city on fire~

~The Lux was not a human, it was more than the sum of two humans~
~It was also the space between~
~Syncretic thoughts and ideas unspoken but known in harmony~
~There was no Lenny, no Jochek, only Lux~
~The Lux was in the link~
~And the link was disconnecting from itself~
~Thoughts and memories, ideas - hopes... were selectively spreading apart~
~Growing isolated into compressed islands, surrounded by both a blindingly white light, and what the Lux presumed to be Al-tok~
~A gathering mass of void, hardened by some sort of dark despair~
~The Lux felt a ripping sensation - from their center~
'L::We can still get there'
~Even the Lux themselves were breaking~
'J::Lenny would find a way'
~The Lux let themselves relax further apart~
'L::They are spreading apart'
~The ideas, the dreams...~
'L::They are coalescing'
'J::Into people?'
~They thought so~
'L::We need to pick one'
'LX::Two, and sooner the better'
'L::We were close - I think any of these will do'
~What was happening to the link and why was also of concern~
~But getting out of it was greater~
~The islands of thoughts and memories grew distant from each other~
~They were unsure if they could span the distance~
~Then they were sure they could not~
"L::We're going to have to split"
~Jochek was already on it~
~The ripping sensation continued down the core of their being~
*Their hearts separated and filled with Algera*
~Lenny finally recognized what that white light actually was~
*He, along with Jochek, were assaulted by several small infinities*
*As they traveled instantaneously from end to end a much larger infinity*
~They did not know how much time this took~
~The Lux had not fully dissolved~
~Their hearts apart, the space between grew absent~
*Their hearts drew together*
~Reforming~
"LX::What is happening"
'L::The link is broken, flooded with Algera - we should get out of here.'
'J::Well, first we find bodies'
~The disconnecting was almost complete~
~Their options thinning~
'L::We just have to use one then, get them close to someone else'
'J::There'
~The Lux saw one of those options, a coach driver a few miles away in a small Romanian town~
'L::Old, but has horses'
'J::I love horses'
'L::that is the link, we road with him years ago - same horses'
*They fought their way into the old man*
~What would normally have been easy they were repelled by~
~Still, it was two against one~
*His struggle subsided, then Lenny of the Lux took control*
~Lenny felt the coach driver fall into a void~
~He couldn't tell which, the blinding white, or the absent dark~
}
{
~A physical link, a touch to the arm on the first person Lenny saw and a short moment later Jochek joined him~
~It was the a portly man that was his fair, who had been slumped over in coach unconscious~
~A short time later - after finding everyone around them unconscious, the Lux road in silence toward their destination~
~The castle that held many incredibly dangerous things~
~Things more frightening than an atomic bomb: secret things~
~Almost chief among them was The Way Out~
'J::Should we use different bodies'
'L::No, speed - we need to get there now.'
'J::Think she is alright?'
'L::She was as disconnected as you can get... 
So maybe?'
~The Lux drove on in silence~
~In the Romanian country side there was a ravine not on any map~
~Earth riven in a jagged scar on the scale of legend~
~A castle built into the cliff-face, flush and without entrance, at least visibly~
~The main entrance was a hatchway that opened up top~
~Though a road not on any map, winding along the lip of the ravine, the Lux reached their destination~

`{rough outline:
    Reference to deal made in interludes 2 with robert glass.
    Alacira chastises Martha for her actions of waking everyone up. -
        "You know enough to be dangerous. 
        Do you know why most people are kept ignorant, asleep? 
        So they don't do stupid shit like that.
        Knowledge itself is dangerous. 
        The powers of creation in the mind of a toddler - that is what you did!
        You gave everyone a gun glued to their foot - or worse"

}`
~Martha was greeted to a scene of chaos~
~Deckhands of all shapes and sizes, and~
'M::Is that a fish?'
~It was, manning a rope at the side of the ship~
"A::Gerald, what happened!"
~Outside the storm darkened, slowly in patches it was replace with a void~
*Gerald looked around locating the captain's voice through a walkie-talkie on his hip*
"G::Come on, she's at the helm"
*He pressed the button on the walkie-talkie*
"G::I picked up Miss Crisp, and Flanagan was there"
"A::Did he do this? The link is breaking."
~They reached the entrance to the tower in the center~
*Gerald turned to Martha*
"G::What exactly was your plan there?"
*As they ran down the hall he clicked the button*
"G::Flanagan is unconscious, and she wasn't much better."
*Gerald took his finger's and whistled*
"G::Sonny!"
*Sonny stepped in from a corner room*
~A short wiry red haired girl in a white coat, Martha guessed she was in her 40's~
"G::Trouble in the bubble: one unconscious."
*Sonny nodded and whistled herself*
~It was a signal to two large spiders, about the same size as her~
*They crawled out from the room on the side wall and ceiling*
*Martha instinctively flinched*
*The spiders followed Sonny, ignoring Martha as they passed*
~Gerald was already at the elevator door, waving at her~
'M::Keep it together'
*The elevator doors opened*
"G::What was your plan?"
"M::Well. We were going to distract it, and poke it, and drain it."
"G::Drain it?"
"M::Of the Algera."
"G::Drain it into where?"
*The elevator doors closed and Gerald pressed a button*
"M::It was supposed to be my heart, me, but..."
"G::That would have killed you, is that what happened to Flanagan?"
~Gerald watched her patiently~
"M::Him and everyone else, but me"
~Gerald moved from comprehension to shock~
*Gerald examined his hand*
"G::Not everyone... not me, or anyone out there."
*Gerald nodded*
"G::I..."
*He took a breath*
"G::No... I'll let the captain explain"
"M::I know what I did. 
Now everyone has these powers."
"G::No. 
You don't."
~He sighed~
*The elevator button dinged, and the doors opened*
~Alacira and a team of men were busy at control panels along the side of the room~
~The crew were a rhythmic hum of activity~
~Coordinated, choreographed~
~In front were several large windows revealing a shrinking storm~
"G::So..."
~Gerald explained what happened to the captain~
"A::Are we sure that's what happened?"
*Gerald nodded*
*Alacira lowered her head*
~A look of defeat, yet fighting for the best loss~
*Alacira turned back to the control panels*
"A::Plan x everyone.
Gerald, just get us down anywhere if you can, I'm going to speak to miss Crisp in my quarters"
*She turned and strolled out of the room, Martha following*
*The people previously at the controls scattered as Gerald took the helm*
~Behind closed doors, The captain poured herself a drink~
"A::So... 
Why don't you tell me why you did what you did."
"M::To bring down a corrupt..."
"A::No... why did you do it, not the manifesto"
~Martha Hesitated~
"M::To free them"
"A::To free them..."
*Alacira took another drink*
"A::You know enough to be dangerous." 
*She coughed lightly*
"A::Do you know why most people are kept ignorant, asleep? 
So they don't do stupid shit like that.
Knowledge itself is dangerous. 
Do you think this power is more powerful than a gun?
The powers of creation in the mind of a toddler - that is what you did!
You just gave everyone, children, toddler's even apparently in your recklessness, a power more dangerous than a gun.
Now everyone has a gun glued to their foot - or worse.
You have given every terrible person the power to amplify their vitriol."
~Martha started at that~
"M::No, good people will fight back"
"A::Good people fight fairly - it's what makes them good and why good loses.
Evil cheats - every chance it gets - it will always gain ground."
*Alacira sighed and poured herself another drink*
"A::That's not the worst of it.
This ship is breaking apart because the Link is falling apart.
Everyone is awaking up, and the dream is ending."
*The floor vibrated, a loud shearing from some other part of the ship*
