# ENTER THE DEN
{
*Martha sat in the center of a wooden bench while Rossin paced around the cell.* 
~Avoiding stepping over her 3 cell mates - his left arm wrapped around him providing a supporting anchor for his right, which he used to scratch his chin and hold his head.~
"He literally doesn’t have a link, not just hooks - it’s like he’s a robot or something"
*One of the cellmates leaned back - stretched their foot out* 
*Rossin pass through it, unnoticed.* 
"You said they were in media - he doesn’t consume any... 
ergo - no hooks."
"Who are you talking to, miss?" 
~a cellmate asked.~
*Rossin waved his hand at that,*~ his free one~ 
"children’s books, radio, newspapers, billboards. 
Fucking billboards - and he just hasn’t happened to see anything. 
not once - in his life. 
He looks like he’s what, 40? 
You really think a 40 year old detective could live his life without consuming any media...
this by the way includes textbooks. 
I don’t think you appreciate exactly how saturated this world... 
this country is in these hooks. 
he’s either a statistical anomaly..." 
~Rossin paused.~ 
*Groaning, he laughed* 
"he’s missing part of his brain.
You saw him scratch at his head - he probably has a scar back there..."
"So he’s a brain damaged detective?" 
~Martha asked.~
*Rossin nodded.* 
"Not sure how. 
I, my writer, always thought the link was tied to consciousness... 
any injury that would cause the link to fail would also put you in a coma"
"Maybe he was in one?"
"I doubt it would be one you wake up from...
Which - also, by the way, is exceedingly rare. 
You don’t just wake up from a coma - that happens on TV"
~The other people in the cell shared glances.~ 
~untalkative as they were, they were clearly being put off by her talking to thin air.~ 
~Martha looked at them.~
"Should we be talking now?" 
*she asked as she gestured to the three in front of her.*
*Rossin glanced around,* 
"oh, them? 
Don’t worry about them, we can always have them forget after - or during. 
Are they making you uncomfortable?"
"Well, no - but I don’t think they think I’m sane"
"So what? 
If you want me to - I could just hook them so they turn around and can’t hear us"
~Martha considered.~
*She shook her head.* 
"It didn’t work with the detective"
"The detective is a fluke - one I... 
my writer - would have loved to study"
~Martha said quietly,~
"What if it’s me"
"What?"
"What if I damaged something, when I was stopped?"
~Rossin considered.~ 
"More reason to give it a try... 
Just don’t rip control from me while I’m connected and we’ll be fine"
"Hey lady, I said who are you talking to?" 
~The tone had an undercurrent of aggression - one that expected an answer.~
*Martha nodded, and switched the flip in her brain.* 
~Before she knew it she was outside herself in that shadowy perspective.~
`Hooks.turn=>{"wall"} | Hooks.ignore=>{"self"} | static | break.`
*Her three cellmates stood up, and walked to the front bars.* 
~each standing in a row - facing outwards.~
"You can take back control now, they’ll stay like that until we say otherwise."
*Martha walked over to them, watching them stare out of the cell.* 
~None were talking to each other.~ 
*She glanced up at the corner of a wall* 
~A small black camera was pointed at the holding cell,~ 
"what about cameras?"
*Rossin sighed.* "Again, it really doesn’t matter, but..." 
*rossin turn toward the camera*
`Hooks.remove_all=>{sequential(["images","audio","memory"].containing("self"))}`
*Rossin looked back to her* 
"anyone who sees this will forget they saw you, and also destroy any tapes or recordings. 
We would do that on our way out anyway." 
*he sat down.*
"Which reminds me.
now’s as good a time as any - what you did: you shouldn’t do it again. 
Not until you know exactly what you did - I couldn’t get you out... 
and I wasn’t with you."
*Martha tilted her head.*
"What exactly did I do? I just remember..."
~Martha searched for the words~
"Like I just... stopped"
*Rossin signed and leaned forward across the bench.*
"You weren’t exactly in your own head.
You didn't stop you just stopped being in you... 
and you weren’t through the link, just probably right outside it... 
you took a step into the back of the mind but didn’t go in... 
you were stuck. 
There’s a threshold, a barrier - one you have to have some..."
~rossin struggled for the right word,~ 
"Momentum to make it though... 
otherwise you get lost in the weeds of your mind"
"But I’m here now."
*Rossin nodded then spread out his hands.* 
"I couldn’t do anything to bring you back. 
It took something physically frightening enough, to trigger an automatic response... 
a base instinct for self-preservation. 
When part of your mind started moving again, you latched back in." 
*Rossin sat up.*
~Aware of something,~ 
"He’s almost here. He’s close."
*Martha pressed the switch and her perspective eventually landed back behind her eyes.* 
~Rossin was sitting where Martha had been in that shadow perspective.~ 
*She closed her fist a few times, testing.* 
*rossin walked through the bars toward the door*
"And about getting out of here. 
I expect it would be a good thing to do sooner rather-"
*the door opened.* 
~pausing Rossin’s warning as it passed though him.~ 
*In strolled a man.* 
~not in a police uniform but...~ 
~a white suit that looked like it belonged on a luxury cruise line.~ 
~His smile made him look like a predator ready for a meal.~ 
~He quickly glanced at the 3 standing in front of the bar and leaned over to look at Martha.~ 
"Hello there" 
~his voice reeked of condescension, and a trace of annoyance.~ 
"Do you know where I was?"
"He was in fiji - tell him that" 
~Rossin said,~ 
"don’t shake your head - just answer"
*Martha nodded* "fiji."
"A long flight, and I find you here..." 
~Behind him was an officer, a large one she could almost remember seeing before.~ 
"Open it"
~Normal words from the stranger’s mouth and the officer obeyed.~ 
*He strolled in and sat in the cell across from her.* 
"Leave us" 
~he said~ 
"take those with you" 
*he gestured towards her cellmates.* 
*After some rustling the three continued to walk forward outside the cell.* 
*A bit more rustling they and proceeded to walk out of the room...* 
*while sliding face-first against the wall.* 
~The stranger looked on, his eyes went from wide to narrow in the span of a second~ 
"Adorable," 
*he turned to face her* 
"so why are you here?"
~Martha looked at him, unsure of how to answer.~
"You choose to be here, I want to know why? I’m Felix, nice to meet you" 
*he extended his hand - Martha took it and shook it.*
"Martha"
"Alright - so Martha," 
*Felix sat down across from her*
~right next to Rossin~
"why are you here?"
"I killed someone," 
~Martha replied.~
"...So?"
~Rossin perked up,~ 
"tell him you were bored."
"I...
haven’t done that before." 
~Felix paused, considering.~ 
"I see. 
You know you can bring them back right?"
*Martha looked up sharply, eyes darting to rossin, who shrugged,* 
"I tried to tell you... 
but you stopped listening to me..."
"How?" 
~Martha asked, she tried to remain calm...~
~but her chest hollowed, an on mix of terror and relief~ 
*Rossin smacked his head as Felix tilted his head.*
"They’re in the back of the mind, somewhere - you just need a...
vessel - to house them."
`['A vessel...',
'just another human?', 
'Any human?',
'any living thing?', 
'wouldn’t people not recognize them']`
~... she held her tongue - intent to ask Rossin later.~
"I figured that’s why you were here. 
Looking for some lowlife to make the world a little better with their absence"
'Okay, so he means a trade - one life for another...' 
~she did those trolly problems in college - morality tests...~ 
~and this one hadn’t exactly come up.~
"How new are you to... 
knowing about all this"
~Martha waited for Rossin to supply a time frame, he did and then some.~
"A few years, now. 
I’m still... 
learning. 
Last night was my first time using a hook... 
it... 
lost connection."
"Who said you were ready?" 
~a small heat in his voice, not directed at her.~
"No one..."
"So you did it on your own, against your teacher’s wishes?"
"No - I... am self-taught"
*A small eyebrow raise,* ~subtle - Martha barely noticed.~
"So… no teacher?"
*Rossin waved his hands - urging Martha not to speak*
~Martha started, then stopped.~ 
*Rossin paced around the room faster.*
"Do you want one?"
~Rossin paused, and looked at Felix in disbelief - inspecting him.~ 
*Suddenly Rossin smacked his head.*
"Stupid men, he thinks your pretty, use it... 
that’s something they teach others - don’t share the power... 
it could be a trap. but..." 
*Rossin leaned in again studying the man.* 
~he was almost... excited.~
*Martha nodded.* 
"I’ve been looking... 
Have I found a good one?" 
*her lip curled just a bit - the way she saw it done on tv.* 
'just enough to...
there!' 
*he smiled back.*
"Top of the class" 
*he lowered his head.* 
"Now - about who you killed"
"My neighbor"
"Do you want them back?"
"I don’t want to kill anyone to bring them back?"
"Why?"
"Because I don’t want to kill anyone."
"You already have. 
The total number of people you’ve killed will remain the same. 
The difference is in the quality of the person you killed"
"I don’t..."
"Okay - first lesson.
Ready?"
~he didn’t wait,~
"you are a god. 
You decide who lives, who dies, who does what, who is what. 
Take a step out of personal morality. 
ask the question: would the world be better if my neighbor was still alive and a psychopathic killer was dead instead? 
You have that choice.
by not doing that and letting your neighbor stay dead. 
you're making a choice.
you are saying you would rather have a random killer on the loose than your neighbor. 
Is that what you want?"
"That escalated quickly... 
I’d have to find a psychotic killer first. 
I don’t exactly have access to a lot of them"
"But you do...
what do you think... 
right - you’re new." 
*he suddenly turned his head to the side and screamed,* 
"ALBERT!" 
*The police officer shuffled in,* ~a blank stare across his face.~ 
"Go get us a killer, a real psychopath"
~Martha started,~ *raised her hand to stop him.* 
*Rossin put his hands up in a calming gesture,* 
"let this play out, it’s what I was trying to tell you earlier" 
*she backed down.* 
*Albert left the room, and was back in moments.* 
~he was holding another scrawny police officer by the collar.~ 
~In Albert’s grip raised just enough for his black shoes to leave the floor.~
"Well that was fast." 
~Felix remarked.~ 
"Looks like... 
Raise your sleeve up a bit, would you." 
*As requested, he raised it to his forearm.*  
~revealing the track maked at the elbow’s bend.~ 
"Yep, looks like heroin to me - so let's go make him your new neighbor," 
~there was a twinkle in Felix's eye, a glint of pure delight.~ 
"Always leave a place better than you found it... 
it’s bad form to trash the playground." 
*he turned back to Albert,* 
"bring him to the car," 
*he extended his hand to her* 
"let’s get out of here, shall we?" 
*Martha took it.*
*Rossin leaned over to her* 
"this is a stroke of luck - he’s not trying to erase you... 
I think that’s lucky at least..."
~They left the room the holding cell was in.~
~Only to find the police station quiet and still.~
~With no police officer, or anyone in the station moving or making a sound. ~
~They stood where they had been doing something~  
~eyes all glassy forward staring showing nobody was home.~ 
*Albert pushed open the double front doors to the station and opened to dawn’s light.* 
*As they closed hands twitched and faces contorted. *
~Where people spilled papers they cleaned up.~ 
~Where coffee was spilt it was soaked. ~
~Each were busy in their own personal mess they didn’t notice each other’s.~
