# A STONE WALLED KINK
{
mn:K
~Detective Kent Barbado watched the interrogation.~
~It was hilarious to him that Albert - normally so reserved - was getting as frustrated as he was with someone who wouldn't talk back.~
*Kent watched Albert rise up, and lean over the table.*
~A feat by the measure of his belly pressed against the table...~
~If Kent's crux was coffee, Albert's was sugar - and carbohydrates in the form of croissants.~
*He sipped his coffee.*
~It was after 4am and he was on overtime...~
'Double time actually'
~He thought as he looked at the clock seeing it half past the hour.~
}
{
*He scratched the matted back part of his hair, a nervous habit as he ran through the events as he sipped.*
~A phone call alerted them to the dead body.~
~He had been there.~
~Dead body by the center of the couch, no obvious markings, and sobbing relative, recently returning from a bar...~
~And a catatonic neighbor with a bloody shirt on.~
'But not his blood'
~A quick blood type analysis showed that.~
~Type o negative, not b+.~
~They'd have a few hours, Maybe even a day or more for the toxicology report to run.~
~He wasn't sure how long the backlog was.~
*Albert was shouting now, trying to provoke any response.*
*Kent sighed and made his way in the room - ushering Albert out.*
*He sat in the chair across from her: so far she hasn't responded.*
"K::Sorry about that, he usually has such a good temper."
*He reached to his side and pulled out a small flashlight and waved it across her face.*
~Pupils pulled in, as he scanned it across her face.~
"K::Good pupil response..."
*He put it away.*
"K::Are you in there?"
~She did not respond.~
*Kent sighed and considered: he pulled out his notebook from his overcoat's breast pocket and a pencil from the other.*
}
{
~A thought crossed his mind.~
*Tapping his pencil across the book he considered - he took the pencil and pointed it directly at Martha's eye and pushed it forward, like a slow homing dart..* 'god let me be right about this,' *he thought as he inched it closer *~- letting the shape of things to come sink in her head.~ 
~He would stop it right before her eye, but would keep it moving at an even pace...~
~He was sure she was faking...~
~Or at least: she was in that blank stare somewhere.~
*He got less than an inch before her eye closed.*
~Just the one.~
~Her other eye continued to stare forward.~
~Not the dramatic reaction he was hoping for but something nonetheless.~
*He pulled the pencil back and her closed eye opened.*
*Then closed - with the other one.*
*She blinked in rapid succession and wobbled her head, slowly coming to focus on the desk, then around her - then at him.* 
*She tried to back away but was stopped by the handcuffs through the loop at the center of her edge of the table.*
"K::Awake now are we?"
*He started writing down in his notebook...*
~Well: Doodling actually.~
"K::Martha?"
}
{
*Martha looked around the room.*
~She wasn't focused on him.~
"M::Well I've been... 
I don't know where I was."
}
{
*Kent leaned in, drawing her to look at him.*
"K::Do you know where you are now?"
}
{
*She turned to him, Then looked at the mirror behind him.*
"M::Police station and I don't know how to do that... 
Well deal with it,"
*She had turned her face away from him.*
}
{
'Okay, so if the catatonic state was just any indicator, she may not be all there.'
~He wondered what the tox report would come back as.~
"K::Martha, I'm detective Kent, do you know why you're here?"
*Martha paused, then shifted her weight,*
}
{
"M::I... 
Well, I wasn't moving, and you found my neighbor"
"K::Can you tell me anything about what happened?"
*Martha barked a stifled laugh, *
"M::You wouldn't believe me"
*Kent took a sip from his coffee.*
"K::I see a lot of weird shit, it's 4am, how about you just tell me... 
In your own words."
*Martha paused.*
*Her eyes darted to the side.*
"M::No I won't do that."
*Kent shifted forward*
"K::Well if you aren't..."
"M::I mean - I'll tell you, just give me a minute"
*Kent waited - Martha sighed.*
"M::Okay. I have had a long night, a long weekend actually. 
I'm not sure exactly where to start... 
I'll just... 
Look - this is not..."
}
{
*A tapping came at the door, Kent looked up.*
*Another set of tapping...*
~A rhythmic knock he knew too well.~
"K::I'll be back, apparently there's something important"
}
{
*Kent walked out of the room and closed the door, Tom was standing there.*
"T::I have the reports back."
*Kent groaned.*
"K::I told you, I don't need special -"
"T::There was nothing else in the queue - don't get you panties in a bunch."
*Kent scratched at the back of his head, absently trying to straighten his hair *
"K::Fine - what's it say"
"T::Clean"
*Tom handed over the folder.*
"T::Both of them - at least in no usual suspects - right now biggest suspect is heart attack"
"K::Right, is that it?"
*Tom nodded and walked away, turning his head over his shoulder.*
"T::I'm not doing special favors for you..."
*Kent stood there, holding the folder.*
*Giving a small grunt as acknowledgement - he opened and read it while he walked back in the room.*
}
{
*Kent noticed Martha darted her head toward him.*
~Her eyes showing a flash of panic which subsided, her mouth was half open.~
*Kent sat down, the folder open on the desk.*
*He leaned forward.*
"K::Tox report says clean,"
*Kent looked up at Martha, who turned her head toward him...*
'She kept looking to my side'
"M::Good to know."
"K::So, want to tell me why you were comatose next to your neighbor's dead body."
*Martha paused.*
'Glancing to her left again.'
"M::I... well, I was in shock"
"K::Normally shock doesn't make you go catatonic"
"M::Normally you don't see a dead body,"
~She countered.~
"K::Well, normally I do on this job"
"M::Mister tough guy, seen all dead bodies all the time, what a flex - I haven't seen one before."
"K::So what happened"
"M::I well. 
Will you just?"
}
{
~Martha stopped talking and looked back to Kent.~
"M::I went over there to talk, they invited me in - then just... fell"
"K::Talk about what?"
"M::Talk about their dog, it was barking in the night"
"K::And he just... 
Fell over?"
*Martha nodded.*
*Kent paused.*
"K::What's so weird about that?"
*Martha's eyes darted to the left again.*
}
{
*And she sighed.*
"M::Fine"
~Kent waited and eventually Martha started talking - he couldn't quite hear the words - they weren't loud enough, but he couldn't make them out...~
"K::Is that... 
Russian... 
I don't-"
*Martha's eyes went wide.*
*She spoke louder.*'
Well...
Was it speaking.'
~Sound was coming out - but it wasn't a language as far as he could tell: just random sounds.~
"K::Martha, what are you doing?"
*She tapped her finger against her desk rapidly.*
*And she shuddered suddenly and the finger tapping stopped.*
}
{
"K::Martha?"
*She paused her head tilted to the left.*
"R::You don't watch a lot of TV, do you?"
*Kent tilted his head.*
"K::No: can't say that I do."
"R::Or books, or movies, or music, or the internet... 
Or get out much?"
*Kent shifted back.*
"K::I mean. 
I haven't been really big into media... 
Or the social media..."
"R::I guess that's a good thing. 
No hooks in you"
"K::I mean...
I'm not addicted to anything"
~Kent notice a lull, he thought she was going catatonic again for a moment.~
~But only for just a moment.~
"M::That's not what he means."
"K::Who means?"
*Martha breathed out...*
"M::I mean: literal... 
Well... 
Not literal - figurative... 
No they really exist, just not a literal hook - you don't have any apparently."
}
{
*Martha paused again and looked to her left.*
"K::Okay you keep doing that"
"M::What?"
"K::Looking off to your side."
*He looked over his shoulder.*
"K::There's nothing there"
*Martha laughed.*
"M::Not for you."
*Kent tilted his head.*
}
{
*Martha sighed.*
"M::I'm sorry, I don't find this situation funny... 
Not ha ha funny... 
Just type 2 funny."
"K::Type 2 funny?"
*Kent raised an eyebrow.*
"M::Types of fun...
Something my mother... 
See there's 3 types of fun. 
Type one fun is fun in the moment, you're having a good time. 
It's what you think of as fun... 
Type 2 fun is fun after the fact, when you're safe - like after running from a bear or surviving the the siberian wilderness naked for 6 weeks"
"K::You aren't saying you were in Siberia?"
"M::No, it's just an example"
"K::And what's the third type of fun?"
~Martha paused,~
"M::Fun other's have after you've died from type 2 fun."
~A silence fell over them, broken by Kent's cough,~
"K::That's a little morbid, don't you think?"
*Martha nodded, *~lost in thought.~
"M::Type 2 and 3 look the same in the moment...
That's why type 2 is fun at all"
*She breathed again.*
"M::That's what my mother said, at least"
}
{
~Kent sighed. ~
"K::Okay, I'm going to ask you point blank, did you kill her?"
*Martha shifted in her seat.*
"M::I... 
I don't quite know how to answer that"
"K::A simple yes or no would -"
"M::I broke the connection, I'm responsible... 
But I don't think I killed her, not exactly"
~Kent waited, but Martha said nothing further ~
*Her head tilted slightly to the side...*
~He watched her, her eyes were following something...~
~Back and forth.~
"K::Connection?"
"M::You don't have any hooks, he did"
}
{
*Kent raised his hand to support his head, his fingers reaching back to scratch the back.*
~The coffee was weak, and it was late, he felt his patience running thin.~
"K::You want to make that make a little more sense to me?"
"M::I'm not sure I can"
"K::When you say connection...?"
"M::I can't really explain it...
 I don't really know myself"
~Kent turned the words said back in his mind.~
"K::When you said you had a rough weekend, what did you mean?"
"M::I...
I think I want to talk to a lawyer"
"K::Fine. just... 
We'll put you in the holding cell...
We'll be able to get someone in the morning - two hours from now... 
That alright with you?"
*Martha nodded and he stood up,*
"K::I'll get someone for those cuffs, just stay there"
~Martha understood that ironic tone:~
*She sardonically jazz hands'ed causing the metal chains to jiggle.*
