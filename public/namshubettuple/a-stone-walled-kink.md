# A STONE WALLED KINK
{
~Detective Kent Barbado watched the interrogation.~
~It was hilarious to him that Albert - normally so reserved - was getting as frustrated as he was with someone who wouldn’t talk back.~
*Kent watched Albert rise up, and lean over the table.*
~A feat by the measure of his belly pressed against the table...~
~If Kent’s crux was coffee, Albert’s was sugar - and carbohydrates in the form of croissants.~
*He sipped his coffee.*
~It was after 4am and he was on overtime...~
'Double time actually'
~He thought as he looked at the clock seeing it half past the hour.~
}
{
*He scratched the matted back part of his hair, a nervous habit as he ran through the events as he sipped.*
~A phone call alerted them to the dead body.~
~He had been there.~
~Dead body by the center of the couch, no obvious markings, and sobbing relative, recently returning from a bar...~
~And a catatonic neighbor with a bloody shirt on.~
'But not his blood'
~A quick blood type analysis showed that.~
~Type o negative, not b+.~
~They’d have a few hours, Maybe even a day or more for the toxicology report to run.~
~He wasn’t sure how long the backlog was.~
*Albert was shouting now, trying to provoke any response.*
*Kent sighed and made his way in the room - ushering Albert out.*
*He sat in the chair across from her: so far she hasn’t responded.*
"Sorry about that, he usually has such a good temper."
~Kent started.~
*He reached to his side and pulled out a small flashlight and waved it across her face.*
~Pupils pulled in, as he scanned it across her face.~
"Good pupil response..."
*He put it away.*
"Are you in there?"
~She did not respond.~
*Kent sighed and considered: he pulled out his notebook from his overcoat’s breast pocket and a pencil from the other.*
}
{
~A thought crossed his mind.~
*Tapping his pencil across the book he considered - he took the pencil and pointed it directly at Martha’s eye and pushed it forward, like a slow homing dart..* 'god let me be right about this,' *he thought as he inched it closer *~- letting the shape of things to come sink in her head.~ 
~He would stop it right before her eye, but would keep it moving at an even pace...~
~He was sure she was faking...~
~Or at least: she was in that blank stare somewhere.~
*He got less than an inch before her eye closed.*
~Just the one.~
~Her other eye continued to stare forward.~
~Not the dramatic reaction he was hoping for but something nonetheless.~
*He pulled the pencil back and her closed eye opened.*
*Then closed - with the other one.*
*She blinked in rapid succession and wobbled her head, slowly coming to focus on the desk, then around her - then at him.* 
*She tried to back away but was stopped by the handcuffs through the loop at the center of her edge of the table.*
"Awake now are we?"
*He started writing down in his notebook...*
~Well: Doodling actually.~
"Martha?"
}
{
*Martha looked around the room.*
~She wasn’t focused on him.~
"Well I’ve been... 
I don’t know where I was."
}
{
*Kent leaned in, drawing her to look at him.*
"Do you know where you are now?"
}
{
*She turned to him, Then looked at the mirror behind him.*
"Police station and I don’t know how to do that... 
Well deal with it,"
*She had turned her face away from him.*
}
{
'Okay, so if the catatonic state was just any indicator, she wasn’t all there.'
~He wondered what the tox report would come back as.~
"Martha, I’m detective Kent, do you know why you’re here?"
*Martha paused, then shifted her weight,*
}
{
"I... 
Well, I wasn’t moving, and you found my neighbor"
"Can you tell me anything about what happened?"
*Martha barked a stifled laugh, *"You wouldn’t believe me"
*Kent took a sip from his coffee.*
"I see a lot of weird shit, it’s 4am, how about you just tell me... 
In your own words."
*Martha paused.*
*Her eyes darted to the side.*
"No I won’t do that."
*Kent shifted forward*
"Well if you aren't..."
"I mean - I’ll tell you, just give me a minute"
*Kent waited - Martha sighed.*
"Okay. I have had a long night, a long weekend actually. 
I’m not sure exactly where to start... 
I’ll just... 
Look - this is not..."
}
{
*A tapping came at the door, Kent looked up.*
*Another set of tapping...*
~A rhythmic knock he knew too well.~
"I’ll be back, apparently there’s something important"
}
{
*Kent walked out of the room and closed the door, Tom was standing there.*
"I have the reports back."
*Kent groaned.*
"I told you, I don’t need special -"
"There was nothing else in the queue - don’t get you panties in a bunch."
*Kent scratched at the back of his head, absently trying to straighten his hair *
"Fine - what’s it say"
"Clean"
*Tom handed over the folder.*
"Both of them - at least in no usual suspects - right now biggest suspect is heart attack"
"Right, is that it?"
*Tom nodded and walked away, turning his head over his shoulder.*
"I’m not doing special favors for you..."
*Kent stood there, holding the folder.*
*Giving a small grunt as acknowledgement - he opened and read it while he walked back in the room.*
}
{
*Kent noticed Martha darted her head toward him.*
~Her eyes showing a flash of panic which subsided, her mouth was half open.~
*Kent sat down, the folder open on the desk.*
*He leaned forward.*
"Tox report says clean,"
*Kent looked up at Martha, who turned her head toward him...*
'She kept looking to my side'
"Good to know."
"So, want to tell me why you were comatose next to your neighbor's dead body."
*Martha paused.*
'Glacing to her left again.'
"I... well, I was in shock"
"Normally shock doesn’t make you go catatonic"
"Normally you don’t see a dead body,"
~She countered.~
"Well, normally I do on this job"
"Mister tough guy, seen all dead bodies all the time, what a flex - I haven’t seen one before."
"So what happened"
"I well. 
Will you just?"
}
{
~Martha stopped talking and looked back to Kent.~
"I went over there to talk, they invited me in - then just... fell"
"Talk about what?"
"Talk about their dog, it was barking in the night"
"And she just... 
Fell over?"
*Martha nodded.*
*Kent paused.*
"What’s so weird about that?"
*Martha’s eyes darted to the left again.*
}
{
*And she sighed.*
"Fine"
~Kent waited and eventually Martha started talking - he couldn’t quite hear the words - they weren’t loud enough, but he couldn’t make them out...~
"is that... 
Russian... 
I don’t-"
*Martha’s eyes went wide.*
*She spoke louder.*'
Well...
Was it speaking.'
~Sound was coming out - but it wasn’t a language as far as he could tell: just random sounds.~
"Martha, what are you doing?"
*She tapped her finger against her desk rapidly.*
*And she shuddered suddenly and the finger tapping stopped.*
}
{
"Martha?"
*She paused her head tilted to the left.*
"You don’t watch a lot of TV, do you?"
*Kent tilted his head.*
"No: can't say that I do."
"Or books, or movies, or music, or the internet... 
Or get out much?"
*Kent shifted back.*
"I mean. 
I haven’t been really big into media... 
Or the social media..."
"I guess that’s a good thing. 
No hooks in you"
"I mean...
I’m not addicted to anything"
"That’s not what I mean."
*Martha breathed out...*
"I mean literal... 
well... 
Not literal - figurative... 
No they really exist, just not a literal hook - you don’t have any."
}
{
*Martha paused again and looked to her left.*
"Okay you keep doing that"
"What?"
"Looking off to your side."
*He looked over his shoulder.*
"There’s nothing there"
*Martha laughed.*
"Not for you."
*Kent tilted his head.*
}
{
*Martha sighed.*
"I’m sorry, I don’t find this situation funny... 
Not ha ha funny... 
Just type 2 funny."
"Type 2 funny?"
*Kent raised an eyebrow.*
"Types of fun...
Something my mother... 
See there’s 3 types of fun. 
Type one fun is fun in the moment, you’re having a good time. 
It’s what you think of as fun... 
Type 2 fun is fun after the fact, when you’re safe - like after running from a bear or surviving the the siberian wilderness naked for 6 weeks"
"You aren’t saying you were in syberia?"
"No, it’s just an example"
"And what’s the third type of fun?"
~Martha paused,~
"Fun other’s have after your death"
~A silence fell over them, broken by Kent's cough,~
"That’s a little morbid, don’t you think?"
*Martha nodded, *~lost in thought.~
"Type 2 and 3 look the same in the moment...
That’s why type 2 is fun at all"
*She breathed again.*
"That’s what my mother said, at least"
}
{
~Kent sighed. ~
"Okay, I’m going to ask you point blank, did you kill her?"
*Martha shifted in her seat.*
"I... 
I don’t quite know how to answer that"
"A simple yes or no would -"
"I broke the connection, I’m responsible... 
But I don’t think I killed her, not exactly"
~Kent waited, but Martha said nothing further ~
*Her head tilted slightly to the side...*
~He watched her, her eyes were following something...~
~Back and forth.~
"Connection?"
"You don’t have any hooks, she did"
}
{
*Kent raised his hand to support his head, his fingers reaching back to scratch the back.*
~The coffee was weak, and it was late, he felt his patience running thin.~
"You want to make that make a little more sense to me?"
"I’m not sure I can"
"When you say connection...?"
"I can’t really explain it...
 I don’t really know myself"
~Kent turned the words said back in his mind.~
"When you said you had a rough weekend, what did you mean?"
"I...
I think I want to talk to a lawyer"
"Fine. just... 
We’ll put you in the holding cell...
We’ll be able to get someone in the morning - two hours from now... 
That alright with you?"
*Martha nodded and he stood up,*
"I’ll get someone for those cuffs, just stay there"
~picking up on the ironic tone:~
*Martha sardonically jazz hands’ed causing the metal chains to jiggle.*
