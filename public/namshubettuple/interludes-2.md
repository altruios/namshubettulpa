~Robert was in pieces, parts scattered though the link~
~Fragments of a thought, formed together~
~A sense of self emerged, senses emerged.~
~his back...~
'is it my back? my physical representation of a back.'
~Was sticky.~
~He was propelled throughout the link...~
~Slamming into and congealing with himself.~
~His sight returned.~
~His eyes caught something darting around to is left.~
*Twisting his head so he could see, he strained against the sticky back.*
~Tentacles - as far as the eye could see.~ 
~dark pink lines in the blackness~
~Robert struggled in earnest now, realizing he was well and truly stuck.~
'I am on a tongue'
~He realized, that's what they all were.~
~Whipping back and forth like angry tornados.~
*Something flashed across his face.*
~He saw it flutter down below his feet~
'What was that?'
*He looked down*
~he wasn't in the link.~
~Below him was the link~ 
~The connection between minds lay open before him.~
~But they were growing distant~
~this was a void.~
~And Robert was pulled away.~
*Robert turned his head up.*
~Above him was a creature of incomprehensible size.~
~stretching the bare horizon from end to end in eyes.~
~The creature seemed to be growing even...~
~No, he was just getting closer.~
'That will eat me.'
~His struggling was in vain as he was slowly raised up.~
~Moments passed and Robert slowly came to rest.~
*He looked back down.*
~At the end of the tongue was a bulge, fading into white~
~He watched it gyrate~
~Robert turned his attention toward the creature above him.~
~At it's ends - the creature was pustulating new eyes.~
~As he grew closer he realized one eye was watching him.~
'Well, this is a weird way to die.'
~And then he remembered~
'I am already dead...'
'So what is this?'
~There was a pause when he finally reached the creature's mouth.~
~It was about the size of a house~
~Another - smaller mouth pustuled out next to the eye.~
"NULL::You've made your bargain - Why have you tried to make another."
*Robert blinked*
"RG::What?"
"NULL::You were mine, but you have poisoned yourself to me."
"RG::I was yours?"
"NULL::My food."
~Robert took two breaths to think.~
"RG::Does that mean you aren't going to eat me?"
"NULL::I can not, to your detriment"
"RG::my detriment"
"NULL::If I do not eat you, something else will."
*Robert shrugged.*
"RG::If I'm eaten I'm eaten, what's it matter by who."
"NULL::You do not understand. 
I eat only the surface - the uniqueness, not you.
This is mutually beneficial."
"RG::How? I'm dead aren't I."
"NULL::I receive the nutrients I need - and unfettered access to that food source.
In exchange I act as a recorder of lives sworn to feed me, collecting nutrients as you grow.
When I eat you, whats left behind is happy - at peace. for as long as humanity lives."
~Robert had doubts - was he actually out of the link.~
~He tried to stretch his mind in a direction to follow down a path in the link...~
~nothing.~
"NULL::I also shield against others - they have taken root elsewhere, but here... 
Here is mine."
~Robert said nothing.~
*The creature pulled him closer.*
"NULL::so shall you fix it."
~Robert struggled weakly against the tongue~
"RG::Why me?"
"NULL::I can not touch it, it is in you deep: which is why I have not eaten you."
"RG::And if I say no?"
"NULL::To the void with you."
'The void is a mystery'
~He contemplated~
"RG::And if i say yes?"
*The tongue brought him up to the thing's eye*
"NULL::The infection spreads quickly.
Look."
~And he did.~
~Through the whipping tongues he saw the link as he never had.~
~From the outside.~
~From a direction he could see all points in the link at once.~
~Among the infinitely dimensional plane he saw a spot He identified as Al-tok~
~A dark growing withering fractal oil in the link.~
"NULL::I saw how Alice made the serum. 
I understand it - it forced a human to have thoughts it couldn't otherwise have.
Thoughts that have invited... 
that."
~Robert knew the sound of perfect disgust then.~ 
"NULL::You shall create a serum to force this intruder to remove itself from my food."
*Robert shook his head.*
"RG::You want my sister, she was -"
"NULL::And we have her."
~A divide opened in the creature~
~A fleshy chasm - ending at the mouth attached to the tongue he was on~
*Robert was yanked across the creatures landscape.*
~A forest of red-bubble-gum trees stretching into the sky~
~A sky: ideas and connections shown brightly~
~A dark moon growing~
~Mountains that were the creatures flesh came and went in a flash.~
*Suddenly they stopped - at a reeling tongue*
~At the end - being pulled toward him, was his sister~
"AG::Robert?"
~He tried to wave.~
*His arm just jerked on the tongue*
"RG::Hello..."
"NULL::You will construct a serum of my design"
~The mouth commanded~
"AG::I will?"
~She sounded incredulous~
"NULL::one of you - if not you - him, having what he needs from you."
*She struggled against the tongue*
"AG::Why should I help you."
"NULL::It is your fault - your responsibility"
~She smiled at that, looking at Robert~
"AG::When have I ever taken responsibility."
~The eye scowled at her~
"NULL::Your antics will not be tolerated."
*The two tongues slammed together.*
~Robert and Alice felt the impact into each other~
~When the tongues parted there was only one~
'what happened?'
~That wasn't his thought, the voice was wrong~
"RG::Alice?" 
~he called out.~
'Robert?'
"NULL::You have everything you require"
"RG::You just put her in me?"
"NULL::You will be given the formula and process to synthesis"
~A boil exploded next to the eye: a spray of pus rushed toward him.~
~It congealed forming into a tentacle that whipped into his eye.~
"NULL::See it"
~Robert screamed~
~Part of his mind was being overwritten.~
~old memories drugged from the depths to fodder the process~
"NULL::Go forth and sterilize"
*The tongues shot toward the link again.*
~Beside him the mouth reformed on the tongues~
"NULL::I can do nothing once inside. 
You will require a physical body."
'Should I even be helping this thing.'
~It was his own thoughts, echoing his sister's~
'It had promised to eat me after all, if I removed that thing'
"AG::Wait - it was going to eat us?!"
'no,'
~Robert thought at her in mock astoundment~
'a giant creature with a billion tongues'
~He continued~
'has no intention of eating you.'
~Alice's mind - like every mind was a turmoil of stochastic half thoughts~
~Robert waited for her to properly think at him, though he was helpless not to know her mind inside his.~
"AG::Seriously, should we be helping this."
'look.'
~He looked at the link~
~At the growing fractal moon snuffing out parts of the link~
'we can deal with this creature after that, if we decide we want to.'
"AG::do you?"
'do I what?'
"AG::Want to still get out."
'We are out.'
~Robert felt a turning in his head - a refutation from Alice~
"AG::you: look."
~Robert felt his attention turn to the tongues.~
~They were everywhere - touching nearly everyone and everything.~
"AG::We are cattle to it, maybe we poison the herd."
~Robert considered.~
"NULL::We are approaching - I would not appreciate finding another species to eat"
~Robert felt the barrier to the link as a thin soap bubble.~
~Quite enveloped him - as he fell at the edge of all things...~
~Towards a ship.~
