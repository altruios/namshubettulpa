# Interludes 2

{
~Robert was in pieces, parts scattered though the link~
~Fragments of a thought, formed together~
~A sense of self emerged, senses emerged.~
~his back...~
'is it my back? my physical representation of a back.'
~Was sticky.~
~He was propelled thoughout the link...~
~Slamming into and congealing with himself.~
~His sight returned.~
~he wasn't in the link.~
~Below him was the link, this was a void.~
~His eyes caught something darting around to is left.~
*Twisting his head so he could see, he strained against the sticky back.*
~Tentacles - as far as the eye could see.~ 
~dark pink lines in the blackness~
~Robert struggled in earnest now, realizing he was well and truely stuck.~
'I am on a tongue'
~He realized, that's what they all were.~
~Whipping back and forth like angry tornados.~
*Robert turned his head up.*
~Above him was a creature of imcomprehensible size.~
~stretching the bare horizon from end to end in eyes.~
~The creature seemed to be growing even...~
~No, he was just getting closer.~
'That will eat me.'
~His struggling was in vain as he was slowly raised up.~
~Moments passed and Robert slowly came to rest.~
~He watched the creature.~
~At it's ends - the creature was pustulating new eyes.~
~As he grew closer he realized one eye was watching him.~
'Well, this is a weird way to die.'
~There was a pause when he finally reached the creature's mouth.~
~It was about the size of a house~
~Another - smaller mouth pustualed out next to the eye.~
"You've made your bargin - Why have you tried to make another."
*Robert blinked*
"What?"
"You were mine, but you have poisoned yourself to me."
"I was yours?"
"My food."
~Robert took two breaths to think.~
"Does that mean you aren't going to eat me?"
"I can not, to your detriment"
"my detriment"
"If I do not eat you, something else will."
*Robert shrugged.*
"If I'm eaten i'm eaten, what's it matter by who."
"You do not understand. 
I eat only the surface - the uniqueness, not you.
This is mutually beneficial."
"How? I'm dead aren't I."
"I receive the nutrients I need - and unfettered access to that food source.
In exchange I act as a recorder of lives sworn to feed me, collecting nutrients as you grow.
When I eat you, whats left behind is happy - at peace. for as long as humanity lives."
~Robert had doubts - was he actually out of the link.~
~He tried to stretch his mind in a direction to follow down a path in the link...~
~nothing.~
"I also shield against others - they have taken root elsewhere, but here... 
Here is mine."
~Robert said nothing.~
*The creature pulled him closer.*
"so shall you fix it."
~Robert struggled weakly against the tongue~
"Why me?"
"I can not touch it, it is in you deep: which is why I have not eaten you."
"And if I say no?"
"To the void with you."
'The void is a mystery'
~He comptimplated~
"And if i say yes?"
*The tongue brought him up to the thing's eye*
"The infection spreads quickly.
Look."
~And he did.~
~Through the whipping tongues he saw the link as he never had.~
~From the outside.~
~From a direction he could see points at once.~
~Amoung the infintly dimenional plane he saw a spot He identified as Al-tok~
~A dark growing withering fractal surface in the link.~
"I saw how Alice made the serume"
~The creature said.~
"I understand it - it forced a human to have thoughts it couldn't otherwise have.
Thoughts that have invited... 
that.
I can make a serume that would do the opposite. 
A serume to force this intruder to remove itself from my food."
