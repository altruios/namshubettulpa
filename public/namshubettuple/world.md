they hold knowledge as power as a finite resource not to be shared to spread to far.
The lazy have taken to their phones to control people instead of speaking 'the words' - which are generally regarded as too hard.


## The undernet

A group created by Flanagan, a honeypot on the internet for those intelligent enough to be awake.
it is used to occasionally pick out new people to awaken, but more it is to keep 'power-hungry mortals at bay'.
everything about the undernet was to hide the fact that Flanagan was recruiting from rejects... 
particularly only people that rejected the undernet instead of rejected from the undernet...
that was until Flanagan lost contact with his inside man, and a quick shadow fell over the group.
