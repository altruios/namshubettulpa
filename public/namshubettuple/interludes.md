## two weeks ago:

{
~Alice leaned her shoulder against the glass window, facing the operating room~
*she tapped her finger against her neck.*
~Her eyes neither moved nor blinked.~
~Screams penetrated the 'noise proof' chamber.~
'15...,14...,13...'
*She darted her eyes to the clock above the man tied down to the gurney* 
~She watched as the seconds ticked down and his struggles came to a climax.~
'0'
~She paused, he was still struggling~
'...1,...2,...'
*She adjusted herself, face pressed against the glass*
"fuck... come on..."
~His struggling subsided, his breathing slowed.~
*Alice pulled out her telephone*
}
{%%%%}
{
*Juan's phone buzzed, and he ignored it.*
~A seed sparked to life in the back of his mind~
~one he had been holding on to since childhood.~
~He listened to the floor below him.~ 
~All of stock brokers were singing~
~they didn't know they were singing...~
'but to those who can hear...'
~He felt the buzz against his side again.~
~He hesitated before answering~
"What?"
"4 minutes."
"Good, a new record."
"And counting."
~Juan was silent~
"Normal Breathing..."
'fuck.'
~He didn't really want this day to come, if it had.~
~The choir of buys and sells echoed from below.~
"I think it worked."
~Another voice, It was Robert.~
"His vitals are stable: I think it made the transition."
~Juan stayed silent.~
'Could we have pulled anything else?'
~No... in the pit of his stomache he knew.~
~There was a seed going in him - he could feel but not remove it~
'Maybe he could kill it.'
~Thoughts reeled.~
"Yes, what is it?"
~Uri's voice this time.~
"Alice's latest serume looks like the one."
~Juan was looking at doors, exits.~
~A silence on the line~
"Are you at the market again, Juan?"
~Alice asked~
"I didn't think... look, nevermind - I'm on my way back."
*Juan walked to the door, intent on leaving...*
"See you soon."
*He hung up the phone.*
~he stood there a moment, his eyes closed.~
*He inhaled sharply.*
"Fuck all that noise - I'm out."
'Dubia'
~Juan's never been to Dubia~

{
~Al-tok's body jerked as it took hold.~
*Al-tok reached upward, bound by leather cuffs tied to metal bars reachings to his sides*
'frail arms'
*He lowered his arms - then sat up as far as his neck-cuff would allow*
*Craning his neck he saw a mirror - his own shaven head*
'sight is a wonder, but only in the front... so much better just to know things.'
~He heard a door open, the hinged squeaked~
'a creak cascading down by a fuction (9001/27003th, 40010/8002th, 17/35th)'
~He very much liked hearing~
"Hello, my name is Robert, Robert Glass"
~Al-tok examined him.~
'A strapping lad in his 30s., What a fitting name. 
yes: this WAS Robert Glass.
Al-tok knew him, from the edges of his dreams'
"A..."
*Al-tok gasped, then coughed.*
~He tried again~
*He mouthed the words - exageratingly stretching his mouth*
~forcing his voice to work - it came out shallow~
"Al-tok, it what you call me."
"Hello Al-tok: welcome to the human world."
'Well, I figured as much - better questions:'
"Why have you done this?"
'Al-tok knew him, but only as an observer from his dreams.'
*Robert nodded*
"Brass tax, then."
~Robert thought for a moment before continuing.~
"We want to make a deal - We want out."
~Al-tok paused.~
"out?"
"We brought you in here - we want to go out... there"
*Robert looked back at the mirror and nodded*
"We know it exists."
~Al-tok smiled~
"And how do you know it exists?"
"This."
*Robert raised a hand, holding a vial.*
"This would kill any human... 
but for a while..."
*Al-tok raised his hand and his voice.*
"Why: why do you know it exists."
~Briefly taken aback - Robert continued.~
"() 100 years ago found a way there. 
It was in Romania, a window - small enough to look but not to go.
It was hidden away and he passed down this knowledge in our family history."
'What he must have seen'
~Al-tok mused~
'What a miscalculation they have made.'
"Would you help us?"
~Al-tok looked at him.~
'iron, leather, 15ft, person behind the mirror,probably...yes, most definantly Alice.'
~Al-tok smiled and leaned forward~
"Yes. If you help me as well."
'Juan would run, let him... Ozmind could be a problem'
*Al-tok raised his hand as far as it would go*
"if you wouldn't mind"
*He guestured to his arms and neck.*
"I'll push you all though, I can make a window"
'Uri would be fun to consume, save him for after Alice...'
~Al-tok knew so many people~
~Almost all brushed against him in their dreams.~
~Every one of them a delicicy.~ 
~Everyone of them eventually would be his.~
*Robert stepped forward*
"We would just step though."
*Al-tok shook his head*
"Not exactly, more like a personal window. 
one for each of you - let me show you"
`exe -root.__seed`
"You are me now"
~Al-tok whispered~
*Robert hesitated but continued walking forward, releasing the neck bond*
"I am a finger, of this thing growing a finger inside you. 
that seed has been growing for so long.
I've known you for so long"
*Robert released the leather arm cuffs*
~Al-tok leaned in closer~
"Go... give this to alice:"
`
__seed:={Al-tok.run()}
__ac:={Al-tok.AuthCrack()}
titttmyky:='this is the thought that makes you kill yourself'
crash(mes,__ac)=>
    --try:
        __ac.crack(root.add(__seed,{sys.reboot}))
    --catch('e'):
        (crash(mes,__ac.modulate(root.about['e'-1])) |> 
        crash(mes,__ac.modulate(root.about['e'+1])) &);
hooks.add(crash(titttmyky,__ac),"/\b(.+)\b/gm")
`
~What was left of Robert slowly ebbed away.~
~A Screaming blackness swallowed him, holding him tight in his mind~
~The void propelled itself down his limbs, it was a constant burning~
*It moved him more gracefully than had he been in control*
~Robert was not aware of anything anymore~
~But Al-tok was.~
*Al-tok stretched his hands as he watched the news delivered*
'that should open her up a bit more, Robert is a good tojan horse.'
~Al-tok stopped.~
'trojan horse... what else is in this head?, inventory later.'
"Why would you... you..."
~Alice started to stutter, then faulter, then stop.~
*Al-tok rose and joined Robert by Alice's fallen body*
*He leaned down, she wasn't breathing.*
*She gasped a moment later.*
"I wouldn't talk if I were you."
'there it is: that seed'
"there: you feel it?"
*Al-tok wave his hand and Robert Grabbed her shoulder and immidiatly started speaking*
"fuck fuck fuck, oh -fuck - robert. 
is talking, talking...wait. 
I'm talking, oh that's weird, there's a delay"
*Al-tok coughed*
"You're brother is gone."
"He's..."
"No, that's a husk - hollow now on the inside"
"You killed him!"
"No, I gave him what he wanted - what you want."
*Al-tok leaned down*
"There is a way out."
'of your life'
"I can push you though - I can't promise where you'll end up."
'pieces of you'
"But I get your body in exchange, not that you'll need it."
'being removed from this existance and all'
"I needed a seed, a hole for a seed.
Do you feel it yet alice?"
~And she did, she felt a growing empty pit inside her mind~
~The darkness of a swirling drain at the center of her core~
~It was expanding~
"It will push you out there - all you have to do is let it."
'and that is technically the truth.'
*Robert fell over, and started convulsing*
~Al-tok tilted his head~
"Robert... rob...r-r-r-"
~Alice's eyes started twitching~
~Al-tok sighed and leaned over the convulsing body.~
'hm... best to fix that...'
~He examined the desk, and browsed the shelves - in the refrigerator he found it~
~A glass vial.~
*Al-tok took a syringe and extracted the amber liquid within*
"there we are."
~Alice started awake as she felt a hot point jab into her side~
"Too late for him I'm afraid - but Looks like I need that chemical to not immdiately destroy your brains with my presence... 
so thanks for making that: really: wouldn't know what to do without you."
~Alice felt a burning sensation up along her spine, then to the back of her neck~
~She saw the walls waver, and the floor tiles refuse to stay the same size~
~Then came the pain.~
`exe -root.__seed `

"Well, anyone?"
~A silence hung in the small classroom~
*Ozmind pushed his glasses closer to his eyes.*
~In the back, Erin had her hand raised still~
'give someone else a chance - or...'
"Erin?"
"Its you, and every refference to you."
~Erin's smug smile irked Ozmind~
"Close, but that's the simple answer. 
Identity is more complicated than that.
I wouldn't have spent years studying it otherwise. so..."
*Ozmind took a chalk, and scribbled against the board*
"Today's lecture is going to be about those two parts, as Erin Identified: and what are their names?"
"Self!"
"Sub-self"
~Two shouts from the corners of the room.~
"and which one is you?"
~Ozmind looked around the room before again settling on Erin~
"both are."
~Ozmind allowed him self a small smile~
"Neither actually, your self isn't you, and the combination of your self and subself isn't you either..."
~Ozmind finished his sketch~
~It was a graph, with one center node, and several edges connecting to nodes around it~
"You are all of this - a bit more - but for right now: lets go over just this."
*Ozmind pointed to an edge*
"The subself isn't a monolithic block, it is in every other brain you encounter."
*He raised his finger to the number just above*
"memory isn't perfect. 
it deteriorates, distorts, fudges...
the subself is an echo, their memory of you.
Every time someone thinks of you and does something: you exist in their mind for a moment.
but you in this case isn't your mind - it's... 
you... 
a platonic form or ideal.
so 'you': is made of your self and the current state of all the subself network...
and we can represent this: and get some useful information out of this using a bit of math."
~A groan escaped in the back - it was suppressed, and Ozmind chose to continue without ackknowlagement~
~The door to his left opened.~
~Ozmind saw her, thought nothing of seeing her from the back, and returned to writing on the board.~
~He didn't see the syringe in her hand either~
~A scream from the hallway halted Ozmind's chalk~
~A scream from the room turned his head~
~A scream from his mouth took her time~

~And nearly two weeks after the death of Alice and Robert Glass~
*Uri fell to his knees on the snow.*
~He couldn't see stars behind the stormclouds...~
~Or the stormclouds behind the snow~ 
~Just the light from his cabin window.~
'Damn it Peanut'
~He was about to call for her, but lost control of his legs, then his body.~
`exe --flush(--controls).reset()`
~Uri's extremidies came to life, and he bounded up and back to his cabin.~
~He reached the door~
*Uri froze, not from the cold*
`
ozmind:= $self=>Ozmind Yammin
payload:=echo {exe --flush(--controls).rewire(ozmind) && 
    --flush(--structures).rewire(ozmind)}
hooks.add(payload)
`
~His arms were not under his own control~
~Something had taken root, and they were fast~
~He couldn't move, or feel, his mind was locked behind another driver in the seat~
"Sorry, old friend"
~He didn't recongnizing the thought as his own, nor it's owner~
~Uri watched his body move on it's own accord~
"don't worry - you are not going to die. can't have that happen"
~Uri couldn't think, he could listen, he could remember... but he was thoughtless~
~He felt cold, dread.~
"Things are bad now..."
~Uri watched the stranger pull on a wool coat, better boots, and grab the keys~
"There was an attack."
~Uri saw him reaching for the door, and managed one thought~
'peanut'
"hm?"
~Uri felt is mind being indexed, shuffeled though, detailed around this last days~
~Uri watched his own finger tap~
"You're lucky I like dogs Uri, we don't have a lot of time."
*A scratching at the door*
"Speak of the devil"
~Uri watched the door open and the dog hesitate at the threshold~
~He saw himself reach forward and let the dog sniff his hand~
~A few scratches later the dog was on a leash and followed into the truck outside.~
"I'm going to let you think for a bit - get too noisy or roudy - you go back to this, understand"
~Uri did, and he considered for a moment.~
'who are you?'
"Ozmind, your friend."
'I know no Ozmind'
"I was attacked, I had to do some drastic things to survive..."
*Ozmind put the keys in the ignition.*
~The truck roared to life - then was quickly going slowly down the snowy mountain road.~
"Al-tok got to me, he... killed me, in a way."
'how?'
"one of my students, had a nasty namshub on his head, only it wasn't my student...
Not anymore."
'so why me?'
"you? you and me were best buds...
but I had to take every bit of me from you, and everyone else for that matter to survive.
I'm mostly what other's saw in me now, bits of the original escaped... bits."
~Further down the mountain road a small orange glow eminated through the snow fall below~
~Ozmind stepped on the gas.~
'Where are we going?'
"New York, Flangan will know something... he should know."
'Right - just give up all our work?'
"It's not giving up - it's..."
~They drove in silence in a time.~
"It should be given up, we aren't meant to leave..."
~The truck sped up ever so slightly~
"If we made it there - and existed..."
'Like them - we would be immortal'
"That's where nightmares are."
'And nightengles'
"Well, Alice didn't pull an nightengle"
*Ozmind petted peanut in the front seat*
"Good boy."
~The dog waited patiently on the seat, looking lazily out the window~
'We could still try again...'
"We need to deal with the...
We can't just leave it: for one it tried to kill me, and did a very good job at it."
~The car took a corner too fast and slid across the road.~
*Ozmind hit the breaks and the car spun into the mountainside cliff with only a small dink*
~Ozmind slowed his breath~
"I hate driving in snow"
'I could - I live up here.'
~Uri felt a familare shufffeling of his brain - and felt his knowledge being riffeled though~
"No worries, I got it."
*Ozmind turned the keys over slowly*
~The car came back to life~
"For two: it's going to kill us all."
~Around another bend - much slower this time, Ozmind remembered to turn on the headlights~
"For three: it's in the link now. 
And it's growing.
Thus the trains planes and automobiles route"
'So what happens if you use the link.'
"It's not everywhere yet - but using the link: you become a beacon...
it can..."
*Ozmind took his hand off the wheel to imitate a missle*
"Zip right to you."
'So it kills you.'
"It's consuming you."
~There was silence for a time~
'okay - exreme option: nuke it?'
"A start - but wouldn't clean the link, not location based anymore, and probably overkill"
'ineffective overkill?'
"missguided overkill - overkill is great in general."
'so what cleans the link?'
*Ozmind tapped on the wheel*
"I don't know... I'm hoping that Flanagan might.
If not...
We're kinda screwed."
'by the way, that town down there...
has no airport'
"How far is the airport?"
'250 miles.'
"I'm sorry, how far?"
'roads are going to be closed - we should call instead.'
}
{%%%%}
{
~With only one motel open, Ozmind and Uri found the phone lines down as well as the roads closed.~
~24 hours later they were in New York.~
