## two weeks ago:

{
~Alice leaned her shoulder against the glass window, facing the operating room~
*she tapped her finger against her neck.*
~Her eyes neither moved nor blinked.~
~Screams penetrated the 'noise proof' chamber.~
'15...,14...,13...'
*She darted her eyes to the clock above the man tied down to the gurney* 
~She watched as the seconds ticked down and his struggles came to a climax.~
'0'
~She paused, he was still struggling~
'...1,...2,...'
*She adjusted herself, face pressed against the glass*
"fuck... come on..."
~His struggling subsided, his breathing slowed.~
*Alice pulled out her telephone*
}

{
*Juan's phone buzzed, and he ignored it.*
~He listened to the floor below him.~ 
~All of stock brokers were singing~
~they didn't know they were singing...~
'but to those who can hear...'
~He felt the buzz against his side again.~
~He sighed - and answered~
"What?"
"4 minutes."
"Good, a new record."
"And counting."
~Juan was silent~
"Normal Breathing..."
'fuck.'
~He didn't really want this day to come, if it had.~
~The choir of buys and sells echoed from below.~
"I think it worked."
~Another voice, It was Robert.~
"His vitals are stable: I think it made the transition."
~Juan stayed silent.~
"Yes, what is it?"
~Uri's voice this time.~
"Alice's latest serume looks like the one."
~Juan was looking at doors, exits.~
~A silence on the line~
"Are you at the market again, Juan?"
~Alice asked~
"I didn't think... look, nevermind - I'm on my way back."
*Juan walked to the door, intent on leaving...*
"See you soon."
*He hung up the phone.*
~he stood there a moment, his eyes closed.~
*He inhaled sharply.*
"Fuck all that noise - I'm out."
'Dubia'
~Juan's never been to Dubia~

{
~Al-tok's body jerked as it took hold.~
*Al-tok reached upward, bound by leather cuffs tied to metal bars reachings to his sides*
'frail arms'
*He lowered his arms - then sat up as far as his neck-cuff would allow*
"Is anyone there?"
'frail voice, it was screaming'
~There was no responce.~
*Craning his neck he saw a mirror - his own shaven head*
'sight is a wonder, but only in the front...'
~He heard a door open, the hinged squeaked~
'a creak cascading down by a fuction (9001/27003th, 40010/8002th, 17/35th)'
~He very much liked hearing~
"Hello, my name is Robert, Robert Glass"
~Al-tok examined him.~
'A strapping lad in his 30s., What a fitting name.'
"A..."
*Al-tok gasped, then coughed.*
~He tried again~
*He mouthed the words - exageratingly stretching his mouth*
~forcing his voice to work - it came out shallow~
"Al-tok, it what you call me."
"Hello Al-tok: welcome to the human world."
'Well, I figured as much - better questions:'
"Why have you done this?"
*Robert nodded*
"Brass tax, then."
~Robert thought for a moment before continuing.~
"We want to make a deal - We want out."
~Al-tok paused.~
"out?"
"We brought you in here - we want to go out... there"
*Robert looked back at the mirror and nodded*
"We know it exists."
~Al-tok smiled~
"And how do you know it exists?"
"This."
*Robert raised a hand, holding a vial.*
"This would kill any human... 
but for a while..."
*Al-tok raised his hand and his voice.*
"Why: why do you know it exists."
~Briefly taken aback - Robert continued.~
"() 100 years ago found a way there. 
It was in Romania, a window - small enough to look but no go.
It was hidden away and he passed down this knowledge in our family history."
'What he must have seen'
~Al-tok mused~
'What a miscalculation they have made.'
"Would you help us?"
~Al-tok looked at him.~
'iron, leather, 15ft, person behind the mirror,probably...yes, most definantly Alice.'
~Al-tok smiled and leaned forward~
"Yes. If you help me as well."
'Juan would run, let him... Ozmind could be a problem'
*Al-tok raised his hand as far as it would go*
"if you wouldn't mind"
*He guestured to his arms and neck.*
'Uri would be fun to consume, save him for after Alice...'
*Robert stepped forward*
"You are me now"
~Al-tok whispered~
*Robert hesitated but continued walking forward, releasing the neck bond*
"I am a finger, of this thing growing a finger inside you. 
that seed has been growing for so long.
I've known you for so long"
*Robert released the leather arm cuffs*
~Al-tok leaned in closer~
"Go... give this to alice:"
`
titttmyky:='this is the thought that makes you kill yourself'
crash(mes)=>
    (crash(mes) |> crash(mes) &);
hooks.add(crash(titttmyky),"/\b(.+)\b/gm")
`
~What was left of Robert slowly ebbed away.~
~A Screaming blackness swallowed him, holding him tight in his mind~
~The void propelled itself down his limbs, it was a constant burning~
*It moved him more gracefully than had he been in control*
~Robert was not aware of anything anymore~
~But Al-tok was.~
*Al-tok stretched his hands as he watched the news delivered*
'that should open her up a bit more, Robert is a good tojan horse.'
~Al-tok stopped.~
'trojan horse... what else is in this head?, inventory later.'
"Why would you... you..."
~Alice started to stutter, then faulter, then stop.~
*Al-tok rose and joined Robert by Alice's fallen body*
*He leaned down, she wasn't breathing.*
*She gasped a moment later.*
"I wouldn't talk if I were you."
'there it is: that seed'
"there: you feel it?"
*Al-tok wave his hand and Robert Grabbed her shoulder and immidiatly started speaking*
"fuck fuck fuck, oh -fuck - robert. 
is talking, talking...wait. 
I'm talking, oh that's weird, there's a delay"
*Al-tok coughed*
"You're brother is gone."
"He's..."
"No, that's a husk - hollow now on the inside"
"You killed him!"
"No, I gave him what he wanted - what you want."
*Al-tok leaned down*
"There is a way out."
'of your life'
"I can push you though - I can't promise where you'll end up."
'pieces of you'
"But I get your body in exchange, not that you'll need it."
'being removed from this existance and all'
"I needed a seed, a hole for a seed.
Do you feel it yet alice?"
~And she did, she felt a growing empty pit inside her mind~
~The darkness of a swirling drain at the center of her core~
~It was expanding~
"It will push you out there - all you have to do is let it."
'and that is technically the truth.'
