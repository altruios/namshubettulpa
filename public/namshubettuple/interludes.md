## two weeks ago:

{
~Alice leaned her shoulder against the glass window, facing the operating room~
*she tapped her finger against her neck.*
~Her eyes neither moved nor blinked.~
~Screams penetrated the 'noise proof' chamber.~
'15...,14...,13...'
*She darted her eyes to the clock above the man tied down to the gurney* 
~She watched as the seconds ticked down and his struggles came to a climax.~
'0'
~She paused, he was still struggling~
'...1,...2,...'
*She adjusted herself, face pressed against the glass*
"fuck... come on..."
~His struggling subsided, his breathing slowed.~
*Alice pulled out her telephone*
}

{
*Juan's phone buzzed, and he ignored it.*
~He listened to the floor below him.~ 
~All of stock brokers were singing~
~they didn't know they were singing...~
'but to those who can hear...'
~He felt the buzz against his side again.~
~He sighed - and answered~
"What?"
"4 minutes."
"Good, a new record."
"And counting."
~Juan was silent~
"Normal Breathing..."
'fuck.'
~He didn't really want this day to come, if it had.~
~The choir of buys and sells echoed from below.~
"I think it worked."
~Another voice, It was Robert.~
"His vitals are stable: I think it made the transition."
~Juan stayed silent.~
"Yes, what is it?"
~Uri's voice this time.~
"Alice's latest serume looks like the one."
~Juan was looking at doors, exits.~
~A silence on the line~
"Are you at the market again, Juan?"
~Alice asked~
"I didn't think... look, nevermind - I'm on my way back."
*Juan walked to the door, intent on leaving...*
"See you soon."
*He hung up the phone.*
~he stood there a moment, his eyes closed.~
*He inhaled sharply.*
"Fuck all that noise - I'm out."
'Dubia'
~Juan's never been to Dubia~

{
~Al-tok's body jerked as it took hold.~
*Al-tok reached upward, bound by leather cuffs tied to metal bars reachings to his sides*
'frail arms'
*He lowered his arms - then sat up as far as his neck-cuff would allow*
"Is anyone there?"
'frail voice, it was screaming'
~There was no responce.~
*Craning his neck he saw a mirror - his own shaven head*
'sight is a wonder, but only in the front...'
~He heard a door open, the hinged squeaked~
'a creak cascading down by a fuction (9001/27003th, 40010/8002th, 17/35th)'
~He very much liked hearing~
"Hello, my name is Robert, Robert Glass"
~Al-tok examined him.~
'A strapping lad in his 30s., What a fitting name.'
"A..."
*Al-tok gasped, then coughed.*
~He tried again~
*He mouthed the words - exageratingly stretching his mouth*
~forcing his voice to work - it came out shallow~
"Al-tok, it what you call me."
"Hello Al-tok: welcome to the human world."
'Well, I figured as much - better questions:'
"Why have you done this?"
*Robert nodded*
"Brass tax, then."
~Robert thought for a moment before continuing.~
"We want to make a deal - We want out."
~Al-tok paused.~
"out?"
"We brought you in here - we want to go out... there"
*Robert looked back at the mirror and nodded*
"We know it exists."
~Al-tok smiled~
"And how do you know it exists?"
"This."
*Robert raised a hand, holding a vial.*
"This would kill any human... 
but for a while..."
*Al-tok raised his hand and his voice.*
"Why: why do you know it exists."
~Briefly taken aback - Robert continued.~
"() 100 years ago found a way there. 
It was in Romania, a window - small enough to look but no go.
It was hidden away and he passed down this knowledge in our family history."
'What he must have seen'
~Al-tok mused~
'What a miscalculation they have made.'
"Would you help us?"
~Al-tok looked at him.~
'iron, leather, 15ft, person behind the mirror,probably...yes, most definantly Alice.'
~Al-tok smiled and leaned forward~
"Yes. If you help me as well."
'Juan would run, let him... Ozmind could be a problem'
*Al-tok raised his hand as far as it would go*
"if you wouldn't mind"
*He guestured to his arms and neck.*
'Uri would be fun to consume, save him for after Alice...'
*Robert stepped forward*
"You are me now"
~Al-tok whispered~
*Robert hesitated but continued walking forward, releasing the neck bond*
"I am a finger, of this thing growing a finger inside you. 
that seed has been growing for so long.
I've known you for so long"
*Robert released the leather arm cuffs*
~Al-tok leaned in closer~
"Go... give this to alice:"
`
titttmyky:='this is the thought that makes you kill yourself'
crash(mes)=>
    (crash(mes) |> crash(mes) &);
hooks.add(crash(titttmyky),"/\b(.+)\b/gm")
`
~What was left of Robert slowly ebbed away.~
~A Screaming blackness swallowed him, holding him tight in his mind~
~The void propelled itself down his limbs, it was a constant burning~
*It moved him more gracefully than had he been in control*
~Robert was not aware of anything anymore~
~But Al-tok was.~
*Al-tok stretched his hands as he watched the news delivered*
'that should open her up a bit more, Robert is a good tojan horse.'
~Al-tok stopped.~
'trojan horse... what else is in this head?, inventory later.'
"Why would you... you..."
~Alice started to stutter, then faulter, then stop.~
*Al-tok rose and joined Robert by Alice's fallen body*
*He leaned down, she wasn't breathing.*
*She gasped a moment later.*
"I wouldn't talk if I were you."
'there it is: that seed'
"there: you feel it?"
*Al-tok wave his hand and Robert Grabbed her shoulder and immidiatly started speaking*
"fuck fuck fuck, oh -fuck - robert. 
is talking, talking...wait. 
I'm talking, oh that's weird, there's a delay"
*Al-tok coughed*
"You're brother is gone."
"He's..."
"No, that's a husk - hollow now on the inside"
"You killed him!"
"No, I gave him what he wanted - what you want."
*Al-tok leaned down*
"There is a way out."
'of your life'
"I can push you though - I can't promise where you'll end up."
'pieces of you'
"But I get your body in exchange, not that you'll need it."
'being removed from this existance and all'
"I needed a seed, a hole for a seed.
Do you feel it yet alice?"
~And she did, she felt a growing empty pit inside her mind~
~The darkness of a swirling drain at the center of her core~
~It was expanding~
"It will push you out there - all you have to do is let it."
'and that is technically the truth.'

~And nearly two weeks after the death of Alice and Robert Glass~
*Uri fell to his knees on the snow.*
~He couldn't see stars behind the stormclouds...~
~Or the stormclouds behind the snow~ 
~Just the light from his cabin window.~
'Damn it Peanut'
~He was about to call for her, but lost control of his legs, then his body.~
`{dime:script to retake control}`
~Uri's extremidies came to life, and he bounded up and back to his cabin.~
~He reached the door~
`{dime:script to overwrite last script cleverally}`
~His arms were not under his own control~
~Something had taken root, and they were fast~
~He couldn't move, or feel, his mind was locked behind another driver in the seat~
'Sorry, old friend'
~He didn't recongnizing the thought as his own, nor it's owner~
~Uri watched his body move on it's own accord~
'don't worry - you are not going to die. can't have that happen'
~Uri couldn't think, he could listen, he could remember... but he was thoughtless~
~He felt cold, dread.~
'Things are bad now...'
~Uri watched the stranger pull on a wool coat, better boats, and grab the keys~
'There was an attack.'
~Uri saw him reaching for the door, and managed one thought~
'peanut'
'hm?'
~Uri felt is mind being indexed, shuffeled though, detailed around this last days~
~Uri watched his own finger tap~
"You're lucky I like dogs Uri, we don't have a lot of time."
*A scratching at the door*
"Speak of the devil"
~Uri watched the door open and the dog hesitate at the threshold~
~He saw himself reach forward and let the dog sniff his hand~
~A few scratches later the dog was on a leash and followed into the truck outside.~
'I'm going to let you think for a bit - get to noisy or roudy - you go back to this, understand'
~Uri did, and he considered for a moment.~
'who are you?'
'Ozmind, your friend.'
'I don't know any Ozmind'
'I was attacked, I had to do some drastic things to survive...'
*Ozmind put the keys in the ignition.*
~The truck roared to life - then was quickly going slowly down the snowy mountain road.~
"Al-tok got to me, he... killed me, in a way."
'how?'
"one of my students, had a nasty namshub on his head, only it wasn't my student...
Not anymore."
'so why me?'
"you? you and me were best buds...
but I had to take every bit of me from you, and everyone else for that matter to survive.
I'm mostly what other's saw in me now, bits of the original escaped... bits."
'Where are we going?'
"New York, Flangan will know something... he should know."
'right - just give up all our work?'
"It's not giving up - it's..."
~They drove in silence in a time.~
"It should be given up, we aren't meant to leave..."
~The truck sped up ever so slightly~
"if we made it there - and existed..."
'Like them - we would be immortal'
"That's where nightmares are."
'And nightengles'
"Well, Alice didn't pull an nightengle"
*Ozmind petted peanut in the front seat*
"Good boy."
