# LIXIN(MERPH)
{
~Felix awoke to his face staring back at him in the mirrored ceiling.~
~the original owners still kneeling at the foot of a king size bed.~
*He yawned - stretched himself awake*
*then shifted through clothing of the man’s walk-in closet*
~he was roughly the same size.~
"Go make us some breakfast - some eggs, and waffles"
~Felix said without turning back.~
~Inside the closet was a mirror. ~
~Inside of which several drawers for cufflinks. ~
~To his left were suits - from white, to black and most colors in between.~
~He felt like standing out today.~
'a nice red suit'
~something to catch the eyes.~
~He was back in the city:~
'might as well be seen.'
~Felix inspected the dress shirt.~
~yes he was almost exactly the same size as Felix.~
*he rolled the cufflinks in his fingers, shifting them into place.*
}
{
~He brought the girl down the stairs~
~she was much younger than the man he sent to the kitchen~
~The man was over the stove, watching the eggs.~
"Scambled,"
*Felix said, and the man started fixing the eggs. *
~the waffle iron beeped.~
~And moments later Felix was presented with a hearty meal.~
~complete with milk.~
*He tipped the glass at the man, then to the woman.*
"Thank you for your service, go eat some yourselves."
*he nodded - then drank.*
~He suspected they were in fact: horrible people.~
~considering the house they lived in...~
'no one had this much money and got it by being kind or nice,'
*he thought while scarfing down the food.*
*Felix handed them the plate.*
*Then he took out his phone and started fiddling with it.*
*He typed a long while, eventually he pressed one button*
*and held the phone out in front of their faces.*
~Their eye’s twitch - a sign the namshub was taking.~
~He wrote them to be philanthropists.~
~Fundraisers for the poor.~
'that was a good thing'
~he told himself,~
'they were probably horrible people - why not make them better.'
}
{
*He left them, taking the keys to their large SUV,*
~the really expensive brand only douches drove.~
~he always wondered what the appeal was - now was his turn.~
~He should check that Martha was listening - that she found somewhere safe.~
~He accessed the back of the mind - searching - only to not find her.~
*He nodded to himself.*
~he did not know how she hid from the ping,~
~but that she was clearly holding back...~
~what was her game?~
}
{
~He drove aimlessly for a long while.~
~He watched the fuel plummet on the inefficient vehicle.~
~he was weaving through traffic just for the fun of it...~
~so far he hadn’t caused any traffic.~
~In the rear view mirror - he saw flashing blue lights.~
*He sighed and calmly pulled over.*
~He waited for the motorcycle cop to knock on his window.~
*he rolled it down.*
"Do you know why I pulled you over?"
"Probably because I was driving like a reckless jackass, I suspect."
*The cop tilted his head - and put his hand on his gun.*
"Oh relax - I’m harmless - I’ve got my license and registration here"
*he held out his phone for the cop to see.*
*He stiffened slightly - his eye had started twitching,*
"who’s a good boy?"
~the cop didn’t answer...~
"When I say, who’s a good boy, you say ‘I am, sir’, now - who’s a good boy?"
"I am, sir."
"Now, go back to your little bike back there - and forget all about me"
*the officer retreated back to the bike.*
*Felix sighed.*
~sometimes it wasn’t any fun to have to tell them exactly what to say...~
}
{
*Felix drove on.*
~His stomach growled: he had breakfast, but not second breakfast.~
~He exited the highway and scanned the streets for somewhere fancy to eat.~
~not that there was much around here.~
~but he would find something.~
}
{
****
}
{
~Light danced across the white cloth table.~
*Martha ideally played with the curtain drawstring of the window next to her.*
~Rossin sitting across from her, he only had to switch to allow them in.~
~he insisted on only the most expensive place to eat.~
~he clained that there was a higher quality to the food.~
~and that she would need it.~
~The other patrons wore fancy clothes.~
*they stole small snapshots from fancy phones*
~the pictures were of her bloody shirt.~
~She watched them.~
~most fiddled with phones, other’s stiffled laugher.~
"Rossin, would you mind..."
}
{
*He glanced at where she was looking, turned back to her and nodded.*
*She flipped the switch.*
~her perspective twisted about until she saw Rossin in her place.~
`Hooks.ignore(~self~) && .delete(media:contain(~self~) | break.`
*She turned and saw the phones slip back into purses and tuxedo suit pants.*
"Martha, before you switch back..."
*She nodded,*
"what is it?"
*a server passed though her - she reacted only slightly.*
~she felt nothing - but still had braced for a crash.~
"I would like to taste some of the food, if that’s alright."
*She nodded.*
~Her stomach was hungry but her body was being fed.~
~she concluded it didn’t matter by whom.~
"Not all of it, but yes.
Just leave at least half for me."
}
{
*He nodded*
"then mind if I have the first bite?"
*Martha nodded, looking around.*
"I have a question: how far can I go in...
this state?
Like if I just walk into the blackness behind you?"
"I wouldn’t, besides: that thing in your brain is somewhere in there."
*he placed a napkin in her lap - properly.*
"While you’re there.
Do you see the board any easier - why don’t you try writing on it"
}
{
~She did.~
~It was like learning to walk - unsure of which muscles to use.~
~only in this case: the muscles were some part of her brain.~
~Occasionally she managed to move the cursor, or write a letter.~
~But each time felt like an accident - and not what she intended.~
}
{
~She still had to close her eyes - even in this shadowy perspective.~
~her vision was still in front of her mind...~
~even if what she was seeing was an imagined perspective...~
~her mind still had to turn to face the board.~
*She leaned back.*
~frustrated, unable to even make even a single letter.~
~Try as she might, brute force of will was not enough.~
}
{
*A server walked in front of her - a large steak meal was presented to her... *
~rossin, that is, along with many side dishes, including lobster.~
*She - rossin, dug in.*
"How am I supposed to do this?"
~Martha asked.~
"I can’t write on that board at all."
"Relax your mind, it’s a new muscle - you haven’t used it yet, it’ll come."
~Rossin said between bites.~
"This is delicious,"
~he added.~
~Martha tried for a while longer...~
~until Rossin was about halfway through the meal.~
"You better switch now, I could finish this"
}
{
~She did, and the first thing she noticed her fingers felt off. ~
~the second: ~
~the taste was wonderful. ~
~a sudden onslaught of umami and salt and sweetness... ~
~in the perfect combination. ~
~she sat there just enjoying the sensations.~
*She shook her hand until her fingers felt normal...*
~It seemed like it took longer this time than it had before.~
*Rossin noticed her shaking hand.*
"Like I said - it does just a little bit of damage each time we do that...
that will only get worse. 
which is why you need to learn to write on that board yourself."
*Martha nodded digging into the meal herself.*
~the flavor in her mouth started to expire.~
~Her stomach was near full, which did little to stop her hunger.~
}
{
*Rossin looked over his shoulder.*
~he saw something Martha herself caught in the corner of her eye.~
*Rossin tensed as Felix sat down to join her.*
"Lovely place you found here,"
*Felix said as he casually helped himself to some of the artichoke.*
"I thought you would still be asleep"
~Martha kept eating, only a non committal shrug.~
"Hunger won"
"Hunger generally wins,"
~Felix commented.~
*He leaned back,*
"how are you hiding - I pinged you, and you weren’t there."
}
{
~Martha waited for Rossin, who didn’t speak at first...~
"I’ve been doing some - house maintenance with our shared home. 
I put up a firewall between us and the link.
Just say it’s a trick you learned on the internet."
"You find all sorts of things on the internet."
~she said cryptically, she figured the more vague she was the better.~
"That’s a very useful trick, I was wondering how I would find you again."
~Felix said.~
"well, How did you this time?"
"I didn’t...
I found a nice place to eat, which happened to have you in it. 
nice stroke of luck."
"It was the best place in town"
~It was, according to rossin, that is.~
"That’s good, why not eat at the very best."
}
{
*Felix leaned back and caught the server by the arm.*
*he showed him the phone screen. *
*the server’s eye started twitching.*
"go fetch me what she’s having, from anywhere."
*the server nodded and scurried off to the kitchen.*
}
{
"So, what’s next?"
~Martha asked.~
"Well, that depends,"
~Felix said~
~he watched her take bites of the steak and lobster at the same time.~
"On?"
*martha said between bites.*
"Your abilities, how far along are you?"
~Felix said.~
"I wouldn’t know - would I.
It’s not like I’ve seen anyone Awakened.
Besides you, that is.
Best I have is some internet videos to compare from"
}
{
~Rossin was pacing back and forth deep in concerned thought.~
*Felix leaned back further in his seat. *
*he put his feet up on the corner of the table.*
"You haven’t been to the back of the mind. 
you know about hooks but have at least some trouble using them. 
and you have a firewall on your brain...
but you spent the night in prison because you...
felt like it..."
~he left the end hanging almost like a question.~
~Martha continued to eat.~
"So where would you rank me?"
}
{
"Rank?"
~felix asked, ~
"you think this is like a school where you have defined grades"
"You said there was a school."
"Yes, it’s more like - a collection of students with a private teacher."
"That’s a school"
"There aren’t ranks."
"But subjects, and classes in those subjects,"
*Martha said, then swallowed the last of the steak.*
"And grades?"
"No grades, if you can’t cut it - they wipe you...
a pass/fail system I guess"
}
{
*felix scooched his chair back as the server laid out another meal like her’s.*
"Here’s to second breakfast"
*Felix raised the small cup of water in a toast.*
*Martha grabbed her glass and clinked it against his.*
~He dug into his food, devouring it with a ferocity that surprised her.~
~She was hungry - but apparently not ferocity hungry.~
`['second breakfast - how many second meals', 
'do they all eat like this']`
~She had a flash of inspiration - she tried just...~
~She moved the list she made onto the board, and it instantly worked.~
~The board flashed the words and Rossin looked surprised.~
"Good job, what did you do?"
}
{
`['Those lists: I can just put them up here']`
"That’s a start,"
~Rossin said.~
"But you should also just be able to place thoughts there the same way. 
not wrapped in a list"
}
{
"This is fucking delicous."
~Felix said in between moments of food inhalation.~
"New York’s food is better.
you’d be hard pressed to find this even in Fiji. 
I missed this."
"I’ve never been"
"Fiji?"
"Or New York."
*He nodded.*
~she had never seen someone eat so fast.~
"You know, the experience is better when you make it last."
*he tilted his head, then nodded.*
~He was slowing down soon - but not by much.~
}
{
"So...
what’s the most impressive thing you can do?"
~he asked.~
`['what should I tell him','switch?']`
*Rossin considered, and shook his head, feeding her words instead.*
"I have that block that prevents you from finding me. 
And I’ve removed most of my hooks myself."
~Felix paused.~
~Studying her.~
"Yourself, you got them out: yourself."
*Martha nodded.*
"Color me impressed."
}
{
~Martha finished the last bits of her meal~
~her stomach was rebelling~
~kept under control by her unsatiated brain~
~she could eat again~
'soon,'
~she realized.~
*Rossin was still pacing in the back of the room.*
~He fed her more words.~
"I’ve been doing some research.
 Do you know Professor Falshtine."
}
{
~Felix paused again.~
"How did you come across that name?"
~Rossin continued and Martha parroted.~
"Breadcrumbs - on the internet."
*Felix only smiled*~ - brittle and partially cracked.~
"He’s the only one that calls himself a professor. 
Probably the only one of the Awakened that actually likes to teach...
He’s...
eccentric is too light a word, and crazy...
also too light a word, just in a different context.
He’s died so many times I’m sure by now he’s a caricature of himself"
*martha tilted her head, *
"he...
probably isn’t even really human at this point anymore. 
he’s something like an idea made manifest. 
or he’s now just the part of himself that lives in other’s brains."
*Felix said, eating another bite, *
"he basically thinks he’ll find immortality that way. 
by essentially being a story"
"A story?"
"Of himself, told by his students."
*Felix said with a mouthful.*
}
{
*He swallowed.*
"He always had some out there ideas...
even for the Awakened - they were...
out there."
"Like?"
*Martha said, sipping her water.*
~Rossin gave words of encouragement. ~
`['clearly he\'s happy with the way things are going.']`
~She was relaxing knowing Rossin would be able to navigate the rough spots~
"Like algera, or the Walkers.  
He thinks there’s people that are more powerful than the Awakened. 
People behind the scenes controlling the awakened... 
or some smuggling thing happening between ‘realities’"
*felix said - scoffing at the idea.*
}
{
*Martha leaned in*
"And that’s more crazy than the awakened?"
"Well, Yes."
~he started.~
"We’re gods, we control the hearts and minds of everyone...
everyone."
~Felix was not angry - just...~
~determined to believe that.~
*Rossin shook his head, *
"always the arrogance"
~he said sadly.~
"We’d be able to control any Walker if they existed, which they don’t."
}
{
~There was a pause, Rossin prompted her - pushed at that thread...~
"He seems like an out-there kind of guy, would love to meet him."
~Martha said.~
"You will: just be patient."
*Felix took a sip of water.*
~he let it dribble down his chin.~
"Are you?"
"Am i what?"
"Patient?"
*Felix barked a laugh, then coughed to keep his food down.*
"Hardly"
"Then why should I be?"
~Felix smiled more seriously, then at Rossins prompt, Martha continued:~
"I can cut it there.
I’m wired for this."
}
{
*Felix nodded.*
"Hope that you are, if you aren’t...
well...
death would be better - in my opinion...
I know people like to cling to life...
but...
sometimes - death is better."
~he said - it was remorseful - hidden pain deep in memory.~
~Martha waited, Rossin urging her to stay silent and wait.~
~Finally Felix said:~
"We’ll take the red eye out tonight. 
Get whatever you need - not that you need to bring much. 
until then:"
*he continued his meal.*
"Enjoy what this city has to offer. 
You’ll be in New York for a long while."
}
{
*Martha set down her empty plate.*
*then took a bit of artichoke from his.*
*She ate it while Felix watched.*
"Have a good meal, I have things to do then."
*Felix waved, dismissing her,*
"7pm, airport - meet me at the front desk."
}
{
*Martha stood, she paused - and bowed before wandering off.*
*Rossin followed at her side.*
"Aye, that was good - going to New York. 
And I’m pretty sure he’s not just going to erase you...
he needs you for something...
but I don’t know what"
*she opened the door. *
~the sun was much too bright - or that restaurant was much too dark.~
~she couldn’t tell.~
