# WHERE THINGS GO WRONG
{
mn:M
*Martha was home, in her home, washing her hands.*
~Rossin's hands, still red.~
"M::Those won't go away?"
"R::Not if you think they shouldn't, I am but thought: remember, think them clean and they will be."
"M::Can't you think them, aren't you supposed to be self sufficient"
*He raised his hands.*
~Clean of all blood.~
"R::Suppose that you're right"
"M::Then what?"
"R::I mean you are right"
*Martha continued scrubbing her hands.*
~She could still see faint bits of red.~
~It was a long while before she spoke again.~
"M::What if the police come?"
*Rossin sighed, and waved his hand to the door.*
"R::If the police come busting in, all you have to do is say a few magic words and they go away.
Simple as that. 
They aren't prepared for, equipped, or in any way capable of dealing with what you can potentially do.
Not that you can actually do that yet, but you can let me take over and I can speak for you."
"M::Speak for me?"

"R::Through you, whatever"
"M::Okay, that sounds like a cult induction speech, what do I have to do, give you all my property?"
*She continued her scrubbing.*
"R::Hardy har har, no - but I know the world you are getting into. Hold on, let me get an update."
}
{
~It was a few seconds later and he continued.~
`statusQuo=>{_
    _placeholder for all data for foreshadowing purposes, 
    meant to be a long list of dramatic-ironic statements __}
`
"M::And that was what?"
"R::Information, particularly about the leaders of the awoken, basic affairs really"
"M::When you say current?"
"R::Current from the perspective of one Felix Danabrus. 
A year out from his last visit to the academy in New York. 
His was the closest, most are in a meeting in Romania."
"M::Why Romania?"
*Martha stopped scrubbing.*
"R::Some thoughts originated there, need to be kept in line every few years... 
Bad things happen otherwise."
}
{
*He walked up to the kitchen when she closed the faucet.*
"R::You've got to learn quickly, they already know about you. 
I took care of some things otherwise Felix was going to come kill you"
"M::But I was going to kill myself, I mean that thing was going to make me? 
So why send Felix?"
"R::If you..."
`Awoke=>(~Aware of linked-cognitive processing~,
~Able to transmit and receive data along the link~)
`
"M::So linked-mind information processing… like psychics?"
"R::Think like mind melding on star trek, but at any range"
"M::So we're wireless"
"R::More or less, yes"
"M::I didn't learn that in science class, pretty sure we don't have wifi in our heads."
~Martha was growing worried.~
'Was he talking about a chip... 
Did the government put a chip in her brain?
No, that was a ridiculous thought though, right?'
"R::Not wifi, linked mind-information processing. 
A functional quantum information transfer method. 
Requiring only special thinking to formulate the proper chemical reactions in the brain to make it work."
}
{
"M::I think that's literally insane"
"R::Well, I mean, you can't argue with results, it's pretty easy to prove that it works with another human."
"M::Right, you're a figment of my imagination"
"R::My author's imagination, and well, a part of you does leak in too.
Nothing's generally water tight like that"
*Martha sat at the table. *
"M::Am I going to get those memories back?"
*Rossin shifted,*
"R::If you do, that thing will come back and get you. 
I won't be able to stop it. 
You won't be able to fight it off... 
Not right now anyway... 
Maybe in a couple of months after you study what it could have been...
Carefully, would you then maybe have a chance of unraveling it. 
I only know what my author wrote in. 
Apparently there were revisions after I was written...
But if in a couple months you face it down, the memories should come back... 
They, well: they won't be good memories, they're buried deep for a reason."
}
{
~Martha sat in silence for a time as she watched Rossin shift back and forth.~
~She wondered where he was physically in her brain. ~
~A discrete location,or a disruption of particular patterns of neurons that fire across the brain.~
~She wondered if she cared.~
~He was here.~
~And offering her what?~
~Power, in exchange for bringing down a corrupt society...~
~Well, the author saw it as corrupt, but was it really?~
}
{
~She would have to see.~
~But the idea of namshubs still worried her.~
~If her brain could be so easily programmed to see Rossin, it could be arbitrarily programmed to see anything.~
~The possibilities rolled out in her head.~
~Impossible before now nightmare scenarios played out in her mind - each one worse than before.~
~And yet - she also thought of the possibilities to fix everything, to remake the world whole.~
~To stop pollution, and all the terrors that could be fixed if you didn't have to worry about free will...~
"M::Teach me. 
I think I need to know everything"
"R::Good that you're willing. 
And if Felix comes and sees you aren't amazingly skilled he'll probably just disobey and erase you"
"M::Well, that's great, thanks for telling me so early /s. 
When's he going to be here?"
"R::He should be he in a few days"
"M::Welp, if he wipes my memories..."
"R::I die, and you go to prison."
"M::Can't convince him to fix that before he wipes my mind?"
"R::I mean, you can try, but I'm not going to incentivise you to do that, that would erase me as well..."
'Welp, he preserves himself. One for the biology is it alive test, only a few more to go...'
"M::So teach me,"
}
{
"R::You don't have a housemate?"
"M::I thought you were in my head, don't you know?"
"R::I exist in your head, but I'm not you, I only know what I know."
"M::No, I don't have a housemate."
"R::Your neighbor then, we'll put them right back when we're done. 
We just need a subject"
"M::What are you going to do with him?"
"R::I'm going to show you the scope of what you can do... 
He'll be good"
"M::Which is what exactly?"
*Rossin smiled.*
~That of a father knowing their child was about to discover christmas.~
*He walked up to the front door, Martha followed.*
}
{
*He paused by the door.*
"R::Let me take over, I can run through a few examples.
And you'll be along for the ride - grab the qualia of this experience."
"M::Take over?"
"R::Right, let me just..."
~And it was there in her head, knowledge of a switch.~
~Not a literal one, but once flipped would swap her consciousness with Rossin's.~
~Martha paused, almost ready to flip that switch...~
"M::When will I get... 
My body..."
~She really was considering...~
'No, not without a way to assuredly come back.'
"M::How can I take my body back."
"R::Right..."
*Rossin paused, thinking*
"R::This should do: but there's no way I can make this particularly comfortable...
You'll be fine."
~And just like that the switch moved.~
~Instead of of vauge idea, it was a solid pin attached to her consciousness.~
~A stabbing point she noticed just behind her right eye.~
~It started to fade, but she remained aware of it.~
~It was pinned to her consciousness, how could she not be.~
~But at least this way she wouldn't be trapped in...~
"R::That should do."
~She agreed.~
"R::It'll get less painful, and it connects in..."
}
{
mn:R
~She flipped it, and felt a ripping sensation.~
~It stretched from down her forehead to her navel~
~An unzipping sensation as her consciousness rolled in upon itself into a wheel.~
~Martha felt herself rolling through random electrical signals in her brain to where Rossin had just been.~
~He was making a similar journey himself.~
~With the feeling of a great stretch, she unfurled into a human shape again.~
~A room, her front hallway where she had just been standing- lay before her in a shaky ghostly image.~
~There was a cone of clear vision emanating from the entity at the center.~
~The center being herself: Rossin in her body.~
~Everything was distorted outside the cone of clear vision, wavy and disintegrating into darkness.~
~The process was like gushing waves of blackness flowing over the shape of all things remembered.~
~Slowly smothering them with time.~
~Even the clear vision was distorted.~
~Bowled in and fuzzy at the edges - no lines - seen or unseen were truly straight.~
~And perspectives did not converge.~
*She walked into the ghostly image and Rossin turned her body to see where her consciousness had entered.*
"M::You can see me?"
"R::Aye, you're not physically where you are, you're just... 
Imagining yourself into existence from your own imagination which you put yourself into just now"
}
{
mn:M
*She flipped the switch back.*
~Immediately feeling that ripping sensation.~
~She wondered exactly how this was working in her brain, or if this was real.~
*She looked down at her own hands.*
*She stretched.*
~There was something off...~
*She stretched again.*
'There...'
~Her pinky had been numb, but now it was fine.~
*She shook her hand awake.*
"M::That's going to happen every time I do that?"
"R::You won't be doing that often, now to your neighbor?"
}
{
*She opened the door, and walked over to her neighbor's house.*
~The one she liked less.~
~The one that had been pedantically complaining about trees blocking her view to the street.~
~The one that  even paid people to come on to her property and cut down those...~
*Martha knocked on the door and flipped the switch.*
mn:R
~After the ripping sensation subsided and Martha was again looking at Rossin in her body.~
*The door opened and Rossin spoke without words*
`hooks.follow=>{~Self~}`
*And proceeded to walk inside.*
*Martha as an ethereal entity followed.*
"M::What was that?"
"R::So, everyone has hooks. 
We, I mean, those in power, the awoken, put them there. 
A set of simple commands that almost all humans have. 
Run, jump, fetch… and the like."
~Her neighbor was directly behind Rossin, without any expression, without anything.~
*Martha walked around her neighbor.*
}
{
"M::How did they implant them"
"R::Television, and the internet, certain meme's, implant individual hooks. 
Follow, run, chase, protect, kill, nurture, spoil... 
There's the whole gambit - pretty much any verb you can think of."
"M::So I can make anyone do anything?"
*Rossin sat down in the chair in the corner of the room.*
"R::More: you can make anyone, be anyone or anything.
You can change what they believe to be true, including about themselves.
You can change how they react to anything, you can change what they love... 
What they fear... 
And the only limit, in the end, is your own creativity."
~He said from her body.~
"R::And that's just the beginning... 
Let's just start there for now, this is... 
Pedestrian"
}
{
"M::Pedestrian?"
*Martha paused.*
"R::As in you'll get bored by this quickly... 
This is a ground floor.
Just what you can do in this world..."
*Rossin waited in the chair.*
"M::...world? 
How many..."
"R::Just two... 
Well, two that we have access to. 
But the second world is infinite...
The second one, isn't physical... 
It's almost like the internet... 
So it's not just awoken whose brains are linked. 
Everyone's brain is on a network. 
Always has been. 
There has been a global subconscious network since life has been even remotely conscious.
Each human runs a little bit of it in the background when they sleep...
And most animals... 
Some insects...
Or when they're awake sometimes too - but it's a persistent network.
The awoken are aware of it, and can visit and control it."
}
{
*Martha paced.*
~She wasn't sure when she would break down, but nope: that was it.~
~A human can't process this large of a world change in what, an hour?~
~Secret societies, borg-like hivemind internets, brain hooks...~
~The fact that she has a forieng entity in her head...~
~The fact that apparently she can make anyone be or do anything...~
~And that was at the bottom tier of the abilities she had...~
~But who was there to turn to?~
~Anyone she could think of if she explained any of this: would lock her up: no...~
~She needed to sleep, in the morning everything would be fine.~
~She wasn't even in her own body at the moment...~
*She continued to pace.*
"R::Martha... I know this is a lot to take in."
"M::Oh you do, do you?!"
~Her heart was racing...~
~Was it her heart?~
~Was her physical body responding to her mental state anymore?~
~She looked at Rossin, who seemed calm if concerned...~
~Not panicked.~
}
{
"R::Yes, I know this is a lot, and there's a lot more - but maybe sleep is in order...
That's going to be a fun adventure, first time in."
"M::Holy fuck - why are you still talking... 
Just... 
Give me a minute."
*Martha continued to pace.*
"M::In my own fucking body."
*Rossin's eyes grew wide.*
"R::Just wait a sec-"
~But it was too late.~
}
{
mn:M
*She flipped the switch and was propelled back towards her body.*
~The shadow world she experienced turning into a wheel all around her.~
~Spinning her about until she was in her own skin.~
~It was not getting more comfortable - but more familiar.~
*She looked down at her hands, relieved to be back as she was.*
*Rossin was pacing around the room*
"R::Well that's mildly inconvenient, I didn't have time to unhook. 
I lost the connection. I..."
*She stumbled over something. Martha looked down:*
}
{
~Her neighbor sprawled at her feet, unmoving~
~They laid face-up with a face twisted, frozen in horror and pain.~
*Martha backed away, hit her back against the wall and slid down.*
"M::I...
I didn't."
"R::This... 
Well... 
This is a valuable lesson.
Just don't do anything without letting me know first"
`['Do not do anything',
'Yes.  
Just... 
Do - not - do - anything',
'Do nothing','']''`
~Martha's breathing slowed down.~
~Her muscles relaxed.~
~Nothing to be done now.~
*Rossin came up to her.*
"R::It's not your fault, I should have warned you - if you break a connection like that...
It's...
Not good. 
But it could be worse, he's only dead."
~Rossin paused.~
"R::Martha, are you listening?"
~He inspected her unmoving face.~
"R::Martha?"
*Waving his hand and getting no reaction he backed away.*
~Martha could see him, some part of her registered him.~
~He was saying something: empty assurances.~
~He was saying things - she was sure of it - she couldn't bring herself to care.~
