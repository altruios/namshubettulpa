# THE START OF BAD THINGS

{
'If you have near unlimited power, what do you do with your spare time? 
Do you feed the hungry, house the homeless? 
See, power isn’t unlimited, no matter how vaste, and'
`(~The power to shape wills is an ocean in one mind || a bucket in everyones~)=> 
(
~Washing every direction such that nothing gets done~ 
	: 
[~Not sharing that power if you obtain it.~, 
~power gained by others,neuters power for everyone else.~]
)
`
~Felix felt the loss as awareness flooded someone else, it was happening more and more.~
~Each loss was still noticeable, the thoughts in his brain more his own instead of the awareness he learned.~
~More and more with each newly awakened human, did his power grow less effective, less pure.~
~This would progress until it would stretch so thin as to be invisible.~
~Until the people practiced namshubs ‘in theory’, the more people asleep the more powerful the awake.~
~Everyone being awake results in no power for anyone.~
~He wondered when he would get the text.~
'A week from now?'
'Most people who accidentally stumble into reality get reprogrammed quickly, or removed.'
'It took a special… resilient sort before anyone on the council would acknowledge their sentience.'

~It was noon, and he was on a yacht in the caribbean sea.~
~Four servants surrounded him, two physical, none were conscious, not in the way he was.~
~He had just picked up the two physical servants from an island where they had been celebrating their honeymoon.~
~No prior servant experience required with the right namsub.~
'Catch and release.'
~He kept to that rule at least.~
'Don’t hurt them, don’t ruin their lives, return them where you found them.'
~He would at least be considerate in that regard, considering he was overwriting them.~
~He tried at least to leave them as ‘better people’.~
~It was a warm summer day, and  nothing to look forward to but for the cool breeze and a margarita in his hand.~
~And his thoughts drifted ideally.~
~Webs of gossip in his mind were unfolding to gosimer tendrils of conspiracy.~
~He wasn’t near the top of the hierarchy - but with a few adjustments - he could be.~
'He could consolidate power and... 
Then what?  
Dole it out all day to particular people.'
~Not only would that be exhausting, Felix really didn’t know what he wanted done other than his own satisfaction.~
'Better to not rock the boat.'
'Scheme just enough to maintain the status quo.'
`req=>{send(statusQuo=>self.statusQuo)};`
~If he had been moving, or preoccupied, he wouldn’t have noticed the request.~
~Basic info was automatic - and didn’t require any conscious thought.~
~He was about to request the sender information when his phone vibrated once, indicating a text.~
}
{
'That was fast.'
*Picking up the phone he opened the text of jumbled letters and contained a picture with markings on it.*
*Taking a notepad out of his pocket he turned to a particular page and checked his watch.*
~12:30 meant line 25, he confirmed the jumbled letters in the text matched the ones in the notepad.~
*When they did: he placed the phone by his eye and his vision was consumed by  a pattern of white and black.*
~Taking in a new thought, thoughts not in your language can be taxing...~
~Really strange thoughts, thoughts with power and shape can be incredibly taxing.~
~But it’s like a muscle - the more you do it, the stronger you get.~
~So he practiced.~
~Every single day after his training, until he could stomach it… but still - he fainted.~
~It wasn’t for long, he hadn’t even hit the ground yet before he came back to...~
~Most of the time he caught himself...~
~The more experienced one’s, the one’s doing this for hundreds of years, didn’t even black out.~
~It’s been 24 years since he ‘woke up’, and he, like everyone in that year’s awakening, still blacked out.~
~Yet he was the only one who still didn't convulse on the floor.~
~All the info was in his head, the location, details.~
~Most of her life condensed down into a pattern in his brain he could unfold, examine, and plan...~
~And there was a notice.~
~She was to be induced as awakened.~
'Not unheard of,'
~Felix let the information unfurl further.~
'Usually a few chains of strings to get inducted...'
~Into a society they were supposed to know nothing about by design.~
~Rich families nepotism and passing on the benefits of knowledge to their youth, that’s one example.~
~But in this case. Felix, couldn’t see the reason for her induction.~
~She was a pleb, a clerk at a grocery market, no particular traits to note either.~
}
{
*He spoke words that weren’t words and the servants obeyed, taking the boat into the harbor.*
~Soon to take a jet to America, to deal with his one job.~
*As the servants left, he watched them.*
~He picked them mostly for their physicality, to satisfy his plans later, which would be put on hold.~
~And others would be found instead.~
'Work before pleasure.'
*He put his sunglasses on before taking another sip of his margarita in the sun.*
~He continued his musings, most of the Erase-ees he helped execute were deemed to be for the greater good.~
~This person was awake and tampering with people in a way we don’t agree with was the general reason.~
~Which agreed with him for the most part.~
~For the most part they had been a sort of evil willing to spread harm though others.~
~while those in power mostly sought power for its own sake over promoting any particular evil.~
~So Felix erased them until they hadn't woken, leaving them harmless and free to live out their proletariat lives.~
~Some people may have been inducted early… really early… but if their crimes were bad enough...~
}
{
'It was hard to police a society of...'
~He wanted to say gods, but that sounded too arrogant.~
~Awakened was always too nebulous for him to take seriously.~
~But regardless, it was hard to police beings that could warp other’s realities.
Perhaps his reality on the boat was a delusion, but that thought always came up when he thought of such things.~
'Can’t doubt your own reality if you want to affect others,'
~Words from the first year of training he had.~
~It was 3 years of grueling training, mentally and physically in New York, and another 5 up over in Bucharest.~
~And this had been the lax institutions.~
~One other existed in London, known for being unforgiving to it’s recruits.~
~Felix was thankful he started off in New York.~
}
{
`['Should I mentor her?']`
~The thought jumped out, shot above these others.~
~He quite liked the idea of taking someone under his wing.~
~Showing them the importance of all they do.~
~Giving them the guidance he had to struggle for when he was learning.~
~It would be some bit of work, but what else was he to do with his time.~
'Laze about...'
~Well, He could do that...~
'Or he could mold a pawn...'
'Stop it Felix, you’re doing it again, just mentoring, that shouldn’t be a problem.'
