# THE START OF BAD THINGS

{
'If you have near unlimited power, what do you do with your spare time? 
Do you feed the hungry, house the homeless? 
See, power isn’t unlimited, no matter how vaste, and' 
`(the power to shape wills is an ocean in one mind || a bucket in everyones)=> 
{
~washing every direction such that nothing gets done~ 
	: 
~not sharing that power if you obtain it. power gained by others,neuters power for everyone else.~
}
`
~Felix felt the loss as awareness flooded someone else, it was happening more and more.~
~Each loss was still noticeable, the thoughts in his brain more his own instead of the awareness he learned.~ 
~More and more with each newly awakened human, did his power grow less effective, less pure.~ 
~this would progress until it would stretch so thin as to be invisible.~ 
~until the people practiced namshubs ‘in theory’, the more people asleep the more powerful the awake.~
~everyone being awake results in no power for anyone.~
~He wondered when he would get the text.~ 
'A week from now?'
'Most people who accidentally stumble into reality get reprogrammed quickly, or removed.' 
'It took a special… resilient sort before anyone on the council would acknowledge their sentience.'

~It was noon, and he was on a yacht in the caribbean sea.~ 
~Four servants surrounded him, two physical, none were conscious, not in the way he was.~ 
~He had just picked up the two physical servants from an island where they had been celebrating their honeymoon - no prior servant experience required with the right namsub.~ 
'Catch and release,' ~he kept to that rule at least.~ 
'don’t hurt them, don’t ruin their lives, return them where you found them.' 
~He would at least be considerate in that regard, considering he was overwriting them.~ 
~He tried at least to leave them as ‘better people’.~
~It was a warm summer day, and  nothing to look forward to but for the cool breeze and a margarita in his hand.~
~And his thoughts drifted ideally.~ 
~Webs of gossip in his mind were unfolding to gosimer tendrils of conspiracy.~ 
~he wasn’t near the top of the hierarchy - but with a few adjustments - he could be.~ 
'He could consolidate power and… then what?  Dole it out all day to particular people,' ~not only would that be exhausting, Felix really didn’t know what he wanted done other than his own satisfaction.~ 
'Better to not rock the boat.' 
'Scheme just enough to maintain the status quo.'
`req=>{send(statusQuo=>self.statusQuo)};`
~If he had been moving, or preoccupied, he wouldn’t have noticed the request.~ 
~Basic info was automatic - and didn’t require any conscious thought.~ 
~He was about to request the sender information when his phone vibrated once, indicating a text.~
}
{
'That was fast.' 
*Picking up the phone he opened the text of jumbled letters and contained a picture with markings on it.* 
*Taking a notepad out of his pocket he turned to a particular page and checked his watch.* 
~12:30 meant line 25, he confirmed the jumbled letters in the text matched the ones in the notepad.~ 
*When they did: he placed the phone by his eye and his vision was consumed by  a pattern of white and black.*
~Taking in a new thought, thoughts not in your language can be taxing…~ 
~Really strange thoughts, thoughts with power and shape can be incredibly taxing.~ 
~But it’s like a muscle - the more you do it, the stronger you get.~ 
~So he practiced.~ 
~Every single day after his training, until he could stomach it… but still - he fainted.~
~It wasn’t for long, he hadn’t even hit the ground yet before he came back to...~
~most of the time he caught himself...~ 
~the more experienced one’s, the one’s doing this for hundreds of years, didn’t even black out.~
~It’s been 24 years since he ‘woke up’, and he, like everyone in that year’s awakening, still blacked out, yet he was the only one who still didn't convulse on the floor.~
~All the info was in his head, the location, details.~ 
~most of her life condensed down into a pattern in his brain he could unfold, examine, and plan, and there was a notice.~
~She was to be induced as awakened.~ 
'Not unheard of,' ~but usually someone pulled a few strings from lower down the food chain…~ 
'usually a few chains of strings to get inducted…' 
~into a society they were supposed to know nothing about by design.~ 
~Rich families nepotism and passing on the benefits of knowledge to their youth, that’s one example.~ 
~but in this case. Felix, couldn’t see the reason for her induction.~ 
~She was a pleb, a clerk at a grocery market, no particular traits to note either.~
}
{
*He spoke words that weren’t words and the servants obeyed, taking the boat into the harbor*. 
~soon to take a jet to America, to deal with his one job.~ 
*As the servants left, he watched them.* 
~he picked them mostly for their physicality, to satisfy his plans later, which would be put on hold.~
~and others would be found instead.~
'Work before pleasure.' 
*He put his sunglasses on before taking another sip of his margarita in the sun.*
~He continued his musings, most of the Erase-ees he helped execute were deemed to be for the greater good.~ 
~This person was awake and tampering with people in a way we don’t agree with was the general reason.~ 
~Which agreed with him for the most part.~ 
~For the most part they had been a sort of evil willing to spread harm though others.~ 
~while those in power mostly sought power for its own sake over promoting any particular evil.~ 
~So Felix erased them until they hadn't woken, leaving them harmless and free to live out their proletariat lives.~ 
~Some people may have been inducted early… really early… but if their crimes were bad enough…~
}
{
'It was hard to police a society of...'
~he wanted to say gods, but that sounded too arrogant.~ 
~Awakened was always too nebulous for him to take seriously.~ 
~But regardless, it was hard to police beings that could warp other’s realities. 
perhaps his reality on the boat was a delusion, but that thought always came up when he thought of such things.~ 
'Can’t doubt your own reality if you want to affect others,' 
~words from the first year of training he had.~ 
~It was 3 years of grueling training, mentally and physically in New York, and another 5 up over in Bucharest.~ 
~and this had been the lax institutions.~ 
~One other existed in London, known for being unforgiving to it’s recruits.~ 
~Felix was thankful he started off in New York.~
}
{
`[Should I mentor her?]`
~The thought jumped out, shot above these others.~ 
~He quite liked the idea of taking someone under his wing.~ 
~Showing them the importance of all they do.~ 
~Giving them the guidance he had to struggle for when he was learning.~ 
~It would be some bit of work, but what else was he to do with his time.~ 
'Laze about...'
~well. He could do that...~ 
'or he could mold a pawn...'
'stop it Felix, you’re doing it again, just mentoring, that shouldn’t be a problem.'
