"M::How far down does this go."
"FL::A safe distance."
~Martha walked down stone-layed passage~
~Small LEDs in sconces spilt orange, reflecting on the stone~
'R::Okay - better analogy, a tick.'
`"Tick?"`
'R:: It attached itself to us via the link, sucked out a bunch of the Algera from the Awakened'
`"Okay, no: so what is Algera?"`
'R::Here is a data file on it:'
`TODO::link to Algera wiki page`
}
{
~They reached the bottom the the stairs~
~A small rounded door made of dark oak stood closed in front of them~
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Inside lay another door, made of copper wire~
~A narrow passage between the two doors lay a panel with one switch~
*Flanagan pulled down on the switch*
~The faint buzzing Martha hadn't noticed silenced~
~Beyond the wire door was a black pool reflected back her and Flanagan's face~
~Smooth as glass~
*Flanagan stepped forward and opened the second door*
'It reminds me of Obsidian'
"M::What's with all the doors?"
"FL::Privacy, my dear, from many things"
*Flanagan pressed in his palm on a part of the glass and it sunk in*
*He repeated this in several other locations on the glass*
*Finally he swung it open*
~Inside was a dark hallway~
*He walked forward and beckoned her to follow*
~She noticed the successively smaller set of cubes she was walking into~
~Wood, copper, glass, each a layer around the room she was stepping into~
"FL::The doors, please"
*Martha shut the doors*
~She heard the electricity come to life after she closed the copper-wire door~
*She looked back to see Flanagan's hand on an identical switch*
}
{
*The obsidian door behind her closed with a thump*
~Inside was a pure dark~
~Flanagan stood at the end of the small hallway~
"FL::Beyond this next door no outside light has ever reached, inside here could be anything"
"M::Have you been inside?"
"FL::Oh yes, many times"
'R::This is going to work.'
`"What is going to work?"`
"FL::We are going to steal some Algera, hopefully all of it"
"M::How?"
"FL::We are heading into the link - We are going to boldly pierce through a collection of thoughts and ideas and steal the power behind them"
`"Mosquito on a tick"`
'R::awkward but apt analogy - mosquitos do not feed on ticks'
"M::So what exactly does this look like?"
"FL::Look like?"
"M::What exactly are we going to do?"
"FL::That thing inside your head, it has a signature of it's owner - we are going to use it to go right to it."
"M::Right to it?"
"FL::I'm going to poke a hole it in, you are going to suck up the Algera"
*Flanagan took her hand in his*
"FL::This is very important, keep this strong in your mind"
*He grasped her hand tighter*
"FL::We are holding hands, as an idea, as a concept - keep it as an anchor"
'R::I do not know if I can follow you into the link.'
"FL::Don't spread out too thin"
"M::Too thin?"
"FL::Yes, right, this is your first time.
Okay - ground rules: keep your thoughts together, don't let them spread out too far.
I'm leading - just focus on holding my hand and don't get lost."
"M::We're going into the link?"
'Wait, us physically into the link? 
How does that work?'
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha nodded her head, then a moment later squeezed his hand*
"M::Let's go"
'R::best of luck, and do not overwrite anything important'
'M::Overwrite?'
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Both felt gravity shift - towards the door~
*They fell in*

~Felix was engrossed in his phone on the park bench~
*Kent looked around in all directions*
~Watching for anything out of the ordinary~
~At Felix's mimed request~
'He has been on his phone for a while now'
*Kent leaned over*
~Felix had covered the top half of his screen, and below was a terminal~
'He was writing some code'
~Kent lost interest until Felix uncovered the other half of his screen~
~It was a bunch of squiggles~
*Felix convulsed in place - his left eye twitched*
'K::Sort of like what I saw on that one building'
~Kent noticed Felix spasms just as they stopped~
*Felix groaned and stretched his neck*
"F::There we are."
*Felix fiddled with his phone some more*
"K::Okay, you can talk now? 
Who are you?"
~Felix shoved the phone in Kent's face~
"F::Who are you?"
"K::Kent, and give me that!"
*Kent swiped the phone from Felix's stunned hand*
"K::You're what I call an ass-hat, you know: using this."
*Felix fumbled his words*
"F::I - make them better people, I'm improving the world."
"K::Violating consents with what ever this is"
*Kent shook the phone Felix*
"F::Whatever this... 
Are you Awakened?"
~Kent did not hesitate~
"K::What do you think?"
~There was a pause~
"F::I mean, I asked the question - so..."
"K::What was that back there? 
That group?"
"F::That group?"
"K::Girl was part of it, that guy whose head you bashed in was too"
"F::One's with the black goo?"
"K::What is that black goo Felix?"
*Felix turned to him*
"F::You want to give me back my phone?"
"K::So you can call a horde of zombies on your side in a second, no thanks"
"F::Then why should I tell you anything?"
~Kent paused briefly~
"K::Martha sent me here."
"F::How do you know Martha?"
"K::Questions later - answers now: who are those people?"
"F::That was Alice Glass...
But that wasn't her that we killed"
"K::You killed: you swung"
"F::You sung that stupid song wrong: that was deadly in of itself..."
"K::What do they want?"
"F::Probably to take over everything"
"K::Everything?"
"F::Everything - every thought - every dream, every conscious action taken in its name"
~Kent contemplate that~
"F::So like: fanatical religious nuts?"
*Felix let out a sigh*
"F::Okay, walk and talk - we need to get back to Flanagan's"
'That a bar, or a person?'
~Kent kept his mouth shut~
"K::First we head back there."
*Felix stared at kent*
~Blankly~
"F::Why?"
"K::I left a thing I stole from them, near the gutter"
*Kent held out Felix's phone, and started walking*
"K::Come on."
*Felix groaned*
~The two walked onwards in silence back to the alley~
*Kent inspected the gutter*
"K::It was right here."
*Kent scoured the area*
"K::It was"
~He checked both cars - they were the same ones parked, he was pretty sure~
'K::...Somebody call the gangs'
'K::He had been bent down over there...'
"K::That guy took it."
"F::That guy?"
"K::Call the gangs."
"F::He has it? 
Well good look finding him."
"K::With my luck he'll shoot himself up with it, or sell it to a junkie"
"F::Wait - what did you steal?"
"K::A syringe...
That they were giving out"
"F::And a homeless man has it now?"
~A silence fell over them~
"F::We should find that man"
"K::Got any nifty tricks to do that?"
*Felix reached out his hand for his phone*
"F::A few"

~The link was visceral, Martha was unprepared~
~She fell and kept falling into a repeating fractal of herself~
~The center of her was a hole~ 
*Martha squeezed through an outline of herself*
'M::A bit cramped'
~It was outlined in her shape, moving like a shadow-play: a reflection of her own movements~
~But a full spectral spread of pieces of her life lined the edges~
~Those too moved like a slowed down projector~
~There was a gap between each moment~
~As she fell that gap grew wider~
*Martha leaned to her left*
~She found herself on the grass, watching herself storm out of the back of the mansion she had been in a few nights ago~
"M::Oh... well then."
*Martha sat up on the grass*
'M::Must be a memory'
~She felt the soft sponge of the grass, it was perfect~
~There was another door closing~
*She looked back up*
"M::Rossin."
"R::Not quite, I'm a memory of Rossin, not the quality original.
But - I think I can get him here - that I am here, sort of a switcheroo"
"M::Anything I need to do?"
"R::Let him through"
*Rossin pointed to the left* 
~There was an edge to the memory - leading back that space~
~And between the memory, and that space was a gap - wide as a small field~
~It was slowly growing~
*Martha approached the edge*
~Martha compared herself to being inside a finger - the gap was a ring~
*She leaned over*
~In that gap Rossin appeared, partially immaterial, bounded behind some barrier~
*There was a crack*
~Another Rossin to her right was banging on the barrier~
~More and more appeared until it was not empty~
~Just a writhing mass of Rossin's stuck together~
"R::I'd step away if I were you."
*She did*
"R::Looks like we missed our chance"
'M::What did Flanagan say?'
~Martha thought of her hand, her hand holding Flanagan's~
*Flanagan's flesh and clothing grew out of her hand until he was standing beside her*
*He looked up*
~Above him was the gap, writhing copies of Rossin swirled and licked some invisible barrier~
*He looked to Rossin then back up*
"FL::That was not what I expected."
"M::It's a mask"
"FL::That I know, but... never-mind - just be cautious."
"M::So where is my body right now?"
"FL::What do you mean?"
"M::Am I asleep in the cube?"
"FL::Martha, dear: you're in the link. you're body is right here."
*Martha felt at herself*
~She seamed solid enough~
'M::But before'
~Before when she endless fell in on herself.~
"M::But I'm physical, the link isn't"
"FL::Who said that? 
If it exists it's physical."
~Martha paused, and after a few breaths felt a little calmer~
"M::So what - I'm really physically here in my own memory?"
"FL::As am I"
"M::Can't we dream our way in."
"FL::We used the backdoor for a reason, we do not want to be noticed."
"M::Also - Why can't Rossin be here?"
"FL::Frankly my dear, I don't know."
"R:: He's a tuple"
~The memory of Rossin spoke~
*Flanagan's eyebrows shot up.*
"FL::No. 
Someone... 
He did it then."
"M::Tuple?"
"FL::He's not a person - like you or I... 
But wow...
He would have fooled me...
He did fool me"
*Flanagan shook his head*
"FL::Time to go either way - we don't have forever"
"M::What exactly is the plan?"
*Flanagan pointed to the writhing mass of bodies in the void*
"FL::See that - we go inside that - and yes: before you ask. it's going to hurt."
*Flanagan coughed*
"FL::Like a lot, probably.
Be prepared for the worst and hope for the best."
"M::Then what?"
"FL::In there - we find a way to our little shadow king"
~Martha waited~
"FL::Then I'm going to poke him - and whatever comes out, you need to drink"
*Flanagan flourished his hand and brandished a forearmed sized thin needle*
"FL::It's probably going to taste gross, Hm - what else..."
*Flanagan waved his arm again and a large funnel settled in his hand*
*He handed it to her*
~She inspected it, to have a cover she couldn't see a seam to~
"FL::Hold it out and be ready, a small sample."
*He held the funnel in one hand, thumb over the lid* 
~He waited until Martha took the hose~
"FL::It's a filter - it's alright"
*And with the other took his needle and slice the thumb*
"FL::Only Algera flows"
*Droplets of blood collected on the surface of the lid - but something else slipped through*
~It was cold and hot, it was every extreme~
~It was a pure experience: her lips, then her tongue touching a pure expression of data~
~A flooding sense of infinity - filling small holes~
~Though it had hardly made a dent in the larger gaps~
'M::Divinity'
~A pure and blinding divinity~
~A transcending moment, where things clicked into place~
~A sense of oneness in the universe, Her life a fractal pattern not just of herself, but of the link~
~She knew the link: a connection, it was more than what anyone had told her.~
~It was understanding that flooded her~
~There was a center to that connection, far away.~
~All at once it stopped, she was standing next to Flanagan~
~An idea she had, now unsupported by the direct infusion of Algera, tumbled and cracked, scattered to the aether robbing her of an epiphany~
"M::Holy shit."
~It was as if every moment of her life had been curled up - and presented as a singular idea~
'M::A freer'
~That was what she was, deep down~
*She inspected her hand*
~As if for the first time... as for a way, it was the first time - knowing what those hands would do~ 
*Flanagan took her shoulder, and she caught the filtered funnel in her outstretched hand*
~She kept the sadness out of her face, the coming betrayal~
"FL::That was from a drop of my blood - I have more than a few...
But Martha - I want to impress upon you - two thirds of the awakened's Algera is stuck in that thing.
You might be... 
Occupied for a time by so much Algera."
"M::Occupied?"
~Martha didn't know all the rules, but that small amount of Algera let her know some things~
*Martha extended her hand*
`-cp G.Objects.jar --~mason~ --~glass~ , *hand*`
*Glass crystallized as her brain processed a new jar in her hand.*
"FL::Algera spoils outside of a host"
'M::Okay, so - outside a host...'
"M::When you say spoil?"
"FL::Evaporate, here - may I?"
*Martha nodded*
*Flanagan shuffled his hands in Martha's direction*
`-tf {
    ~outside~:~steel~,
    ~inside~:-sym link - creator.*heart*
}.then((r)=>r.set(~Permissions~,750)
`
~Her cup changed, from glass to metal, and came with a lid.~
*Her heart pulsed* 
~She felt it echo from the cup in her hand~
"M::Oh that feels weird"
"FL::Keep your heart protected, and set your default permissions."
~Martha looked at the funnel and the jar~
'M::Default permissions: right.'
`defaults.set(~permissions~, 750)`
'M::okay - I can do this: this is easy...'
"R::you can do this."
'M::dream Rossin says so, does that count'
~She decided it did: she would have to let him know~
~She thought a moment longer - then started~
`
-cmb ~this~ => [...self.hands.Objects, 
    -cp G.Objects.armor{~carbon fiber~,*Moulded*}, 
    ...(for x in 10: 
        -cp G.Objects.spike{
                ~style~:*Barbed*,

    ] --auto-format --light-weight --resizable{
        (*curling pinky*)=>~left~?*grow* | ~right~?*shrink*
        }
`
*The cup and funnel morphed in her hands* 
~mostly like she pictured in her head~
~The items combined into a short spear - spikes and the funnel at the end~
"M::This isn't going to kill it though, is it?"
"FL::No, no it won't.
It is far too spread out for that."
'M::This is just like stealing treasure from a dragon, yep... 
And with this treasure'
~She contemplated what she would do with that store of power~
*Martha looked above her*
'M::Rossin said months - before she would be ready'
~She studied it some more~
~She had Flanagan by her side after all~
"M::Can we kill that thing at least?"
*Martha tilted her head towards the thing*
~Flanagan considered~
"FL::After we get the Algera out, before that it's going to be our way in, and our way out."
"M::Any other way out... 
Or in?"
"FL::Out, maybe - but in... that's the way."
'M::Okay, less than ideal, he will not help me after...'
~Martha suppressed the thought~
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha nodded*
'M::Thread the needle Martha - keep it together'
}
{
    %%%%
}
{
*Martha held his hand*
~That was a constant~
*She held tight as she and Flanagan tore through the skin of the copies of Rossin clawing at them*
~Flanagan had ripped open a hole~
'M::THE hole'
~The one from her childhood, the one at the back of her mind~
'M::How long have you been there?'
~She panicked, that hole was death, worse than death~
~It promised so much worse from her nightmares as a child~
*they slid through*
~With the sudden blindness came pain~
~Not just bodily pain: she was riven by edges of the link inside the entity, each connected to a moment of pain~
`~The betrayal of a lover, discovered through an intercepted message~`
`~The loss of a child, by looking the wrong way at at just the wrong moment~`
`~The hate in the eyes of your parents, after killing their grandchild~`
~Worse, and still:~ 
*She held his hand*
~Each moment cutting her, now a part of her~ 
~She compartmentalized them as best she could~
~Her panicked mind was not helping~
~There was no light, no concept of light, not even the equivalent of being able to see~
~Every connection, every node in the link was shrouded, shifting, and impenetrable.~
~Until she was cut by an edge, which was often, she might as well have been in a void~
"M::How are we going to find anything in here."
~There was no response~
'M::Can he hear me?'
~Martha waited, still nothing~
'M::Okay... girl scouts was useful for something'
*Martha squeezed .... --- .-- / ..-. .. -. -..*
~A short time later she felt something back in her hand~
*.. / ... . .*
'M::Okay, so I guess I just wait'
~Martha contemplated how she might kill this thing~
'M::you seem much bigger, but...'
~It couldn't actually be this big, it was just in her head, one brain...~
~She had to be larger - she reasoned... but maybe not stronger~
'M::No - it is in me, not the link'
~Those had been her memories, she realized~
~Divorced from her by Rossin - and used by this thing as a sort of fuel~
'M::I had a daughter?'
~She tried to remember her face~
~She couldn't~
*Another memory cut into her*
~She couldn't accept it~
~She buried that one deep down~
*Martha's feet hit a floor*
~She was in a memory, her own~
~A row of books on either side of her~
~A dark emerald colored carpet at her feet~
"M::Flanagan?"
"FL::Here"
*He squeezed her hand*
~Which had nothing in it~
*Martha looked around*
~Flanagan was nowhere in sight~
~Some movement behind the books caught her eye~
"FL::Other side of the bookshelf"
*He tugged at her*
"FL::This way"
*Martha looked down at her hand*
~She was still holding his hand, she could tell, but it wasn't there~
~She felt it, and him pulling on her to come~
~It was as if he had an invisible stretchy arm that could pass through walls~
~Martha let herself be led on~
