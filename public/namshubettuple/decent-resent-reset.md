"M::How far down does this go."
"FL::A safe distance."
~Martha walked down stone-layed passage~
~Small LEDs in sconces spilt orange, reflecting in the stone~
'R::Okay - better analogy, a tick.'
`"Tick?"`
'R:: It attached itself to us via the link, sucked out a bunch of the Algera from the Awakened'
`"Okay, no: so what is Algera?"`
'R::Here is a data file one it:'
`TODO::link to Algera wiki page`
}
{
~They reached the bottom the the stairs~
~A small rounded door made of dark oak stood closed in front of them~
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Inside lay another door, made of metal wire~
~A narrow passage between the two doors lay a panel with one switch~
*Flanagan pulled down on the switch*
~The faint buzzing Martha hadn't noticed silenced~
~Beyond the metal door was a black pool reflected back her and Flanagan's face~
~Smooth as glass~
*Flanagan stepped forward and opened the second door*
'It reminds me of Obsidian'
"M::What's with all the doors?"
"FL::Privacy, my dear, from many things"
*Flanagan pressed in his palm on a part of the glass and it sunk in*
*He repeated this in several other locations on the glass*
*Finally he swung it open*
~Inside was a dark hallway~
*He walked forward and beckoned her to follow*
~She noticed the successively smaller set of cubes she was walking into~
~Wood, brass, glass, each a layer around the room she was stepping into~
"FL::The doors, please"
*Martha shut the doors*
~She heard the electricity come to life after she closed the metal door~
*She looked back to see Flanagan's hand on an identical switch*
}
{
*The obsidian door behind her closed with a thump*
~Inside was a pure dark~
~Flanagan stood at the end of the small hallway~
"FL::Inside here no outside light has ever reached, inside here could be anything"
"M::Have you been inside?"
"FL::Oh yes, many times, each time different"
'R::This is going to work.'
`"What is going to work?"`
"FL::We are going to steal some Algera, hopefully all of it"
"M::How?"
"FL::We are heading into the link - We are going to boldly pierce through a collection of thoughts and ideas and steal the power behind them"
`"Mosquito on a tick"`
'R::awkward but apt analogy'
"M::So what exactly does this look like?"
"FL::Look like?"
"M::What exactly are we going to do?"
"FL::That thing inside your head, it has a signature of it's owner - we are going to use it to go right to it."
"M::Right to it?"
"FL::I'm going to poke a hole it in, you are going to suck up the Algera"
*Flanagan took her hand in his*
"FL::This is very important, keep this strong in your mind"
*He grasped her hand tighter*
"FL::We are holding hands, as an idea, as a concept - keep it as an anchor"
'R::I do not know if I can follow you into the link.'
"FL::Don't spread out too thin"
"M::Too thin?"
"FL::Is this your...?
Okay - first time then, ground rules:
Keep your thoughts together, don't let them spread out too far.
I'm leading - just focus on holding my hand and don't get lost."
"M::We're going into the link?"
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha shook her head, then a moment later squeezed his hand*
"M::Let's go"
'R::best of luck, and overwrite anything important'
'M::Overwrite?'
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Both felt gravity shift - towards the door~
*They fell in*

~Felix was engrossed in his phone on the park bench~
*Kent looked around*
~Watching for anything out of the ordinary~
~At Felix's mimed request~
'he been on his phone for a while now'
*Kent leaned over*
~Felix had covered the top half of his screen, and below was a terminal~
'He was writing some code'
~Kent lost interest until Felix uncovered the other half of his screen~
~It was a bunch of squiggles~
~Sort of like what he saw on that one building~
*Felix groaned and stretched his neck*
"F::There we go."
*Felix fiddled with his phone some more*
"K::Okay, you can talk now? Who are you?"
~Felix shoved the phone in Kent's face~
"F::Who are you?"
"K::Kent, and give me that!"
*Kent swiped the phone from Felix's stunned hand*
"K::You're what I call an ass-hat, you know: using this."
*Felix fumbled his words*
"F::I - make them better people, I'm improving the world."
"K::Violating consents with what ever this is"
*Kent shook the phone Felix*
"F::Whatever this... 
Are you Awakened?"
~Kent did not hesitate~
"K::What do you think?"
~There was a pause~
"F::I mean, I asked the question - so..."
"K::What was that back that? That group?"
"F::That group?"
"K::Girl was part of it, that guy whose head you bashed in too"
"F::One's with the black goo"
"K::What is that black goo Felix?"
*Felix turned to him*
"F::You want to give me back my phone?"
"K::So you can call a horde of zombies on your side in a second, no thanks"
"F::Then why should I tell you anything?"
~Kent paused briefly~
"K::Martha sent me here"
"F::How do you know Martha?"
"K:Questions later - answers now: who are those people?"
"F::That was Alice glass...
But that wasn't here that we killed"
"K::You killed: you swung"
"F::You sung that stupid song wrong: you helped"
"K::What do they want?"
"F::Probably to take over everything"
"K::Everything?"
"F::Everything - every thought - every dream, every conscious action taken in their name"
