"M::How far down does this go."
"FL::A safe distance."
~Martha walked down stone-layed passage~
~Small LEDs in sconces spilt orange, reflecting on the stone~
'R::Okay - better analogy, a tick.'
`"Tick?"`
'R:: It attached itself to us via the link, sucked out a bunch of the Algera from the Awakened'
`"Okay, no: so what is Algera?"`
'R::Here is a data file on it:'
`TODO::link to Algera wiki page`
}
{
~They reached the bottom the the stairs~
~A small rounded door made of dark oak stood closed in front of them~
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Inside lay another door, made of copper wire~
~A narrow passage between the two doors lay a panel with one switch~
*Flanagan pulled down on the switch*
~The faint buzzing Martha hadn't noticed silenced~
~Beyond the wire door was a black pool reflected back her and Flanagan's face~
~Smooth as glass~
*Flanagan stepped forward and opened the second door*
'It reminds me of Obsidian'
"M::What's with all the doors?"
"FL::Privacy, my dear, from many things"
*Flanagan pressed in his palm on a part of the glass and it sunk in*
*He repeated this in several other locations on the glass*
*Finally he swung it open*
~Inside was a dark hallway~
*He walked forward and beckoned her to follow*
~She noticed the successively smaller set of cubes she was walking into~
~Wood, copper, glass, each a layer around the room she was stepping into~
"FL::The doors, please"
*Martha shut the doors*
~She heard the electricity come to life after she closed the copper-wire door~
*She looked back to see Flanagan's hand on an identical switch*
}
{
*The obsidian door behind her closed with a thump*
~Inside was a pure dark~
~Flanagan stood at the end of the small hallway~
"FL::Beyond this next door no outside light has ever reached, inside here could be anything"
"M::Have you been inside?"
"FL::Oh yes, many times"
'R::This is going to work.'
`"What is going to work?"`
"FL::We are going to steal some Algera, hopefully all of it"
"M::How?"
"FL::We are heading into the link - We are going to boldly pierce through a collection of thoughts and ideas and steal the power behind them"
`"Mosquito on a tick"`
'R::awkward but apt analogy - mosquitos do not feed on ticks'
"M::So what exactly does this look like?"
"FL::Look like?"
"M::What exactly are we going to do?"
"FL::That thing inside your head, it has a signature of it's owner - we are going to use it to go right to it."
"M::Right to it?"
"FL::I'm going to poke a hole it in, you are going to suck up the Algera"
*Flanagan took her hand in his*
"FL::This is very important, keep this strong in your mind"
*He grasped her hand tighter*
"FL::We are holding hands, as an idea, as a concept - keep it as an anchor"
'R::I do not know if I can follow you into the link.'
"FL::Don't spread out too thin"
"M::Too thin?"
"FL::Yes, right, this is your first time.
Okay - ground rules: keep your thoughts together, don't let them spread out too far.
I'm leading - just focus on holding my hand and don't get lost."
"M::We're going into the link?"
'Wait, us physically into the link? 
How does that work?'
"FL::Are you ready?"
*Martha nodded her head, then a moment later squeezed his hand*
"M::Let's go"
'R::best of luck, and do not overwrite anything important'
'M::Overwrite?'
*Flanagan opened the door*
~Both felt gravity shift - towards the door~
*They fell in*

~Felix was engrossed in his phone on the park bench~
*Kent looked around in all directions*
~Watching for anything out of the ordinary~
~At Felix's mimed request~
'He has been on his phone for a while now'
*Kent leaned over*
~Felix had covered the top half of his screen, and below was a terminal~
'He was writing some code'
~Kent lost interest until Felix uncovered the other half of his screen~
~It was a bunch of squiggles~
*Felix convulsed in place - his left eye twitched*
'K::Sort of like what I saw on that one building'
~Kent noticed Felix spasms just as they stopped~
*Felix groaned and stretched his neck*
"F::There we are."
*Felix fiddled with his phone some more*
"K::Okay, you can talk now? 
Who are you?"
~Felix shoved the phone in Kent's face~
"F::Who are you?"
"K::Kent, and give me that!"
*Kent swiped the phone from Felix's stunned hand*
"K::You're what I call an ass-hat, you know: using this."
*Felix fumbled his words*
"F::I - make them better people, I'm improving the world."
"K::Violating consents with what ever this is"
*Kent shook the phone Felix*
"F::Whatever this... 
Are you Awakened?"
~Kent did not hesitate~
"K::What do you think?"
~There was a pause~
"F::I mean, I asked the question - so..."
"K::What was that back there? 
That group?"
"F::That group?"
"K::Girl was part of it, that guy whose head you bashed in was too"
"F::One's with the black goo?"
"K::What is that black goo Felix?"
*Felix turned to him*
"F::You want to give me back my phone?"
"K::So you can call a horde of zombies on your side in a second, no thanks"
"F::Then why should I tell you anything?"
~Kent paused briefly~
"K::Martha sent me here."
"F::How do you know Martha?"
"K::Questions later - answers now: who are those people?"
"F::That was Alice Glass...
But that wasn't her that we killed"
"K::You killed: you swung"
"F::You sung that stupid song wrong: that was deadly in of itself..."
"K::What do they want?"
"F::Probably to take over everything"
"K::Everything?"
"F::Everything - every thought - every dream, every conscious action taken in its name"
~Kent contemplate that~
"F::So like: fanatical religious nuts?"
*Felix let out a sigh*
"F::Okay, walk and talk - we need to get back to Flanagan's"
'That a bar, or a person?'
~Kent kept his mouth shut~
"K::First we head back there."
*Felix stared at kent*
~Blankly~
"F::Why?"
"K::I left a thing I stole from them, near the gutter"
*Kent held out Felix's phone, and started walking*
"K::Come on."
*Felix groaned*
~The two walked onwards in silence back to the alley~
*Kent inspected the gutter*
"K::It was right here."
*Kent scoured the area*
"K::It was"
~He checked both cars - they were the same ones parked, he was pretty sure~
'K::...Somebody call the gangs'
'K::He had been bent down over there...'
"K::That guy took it."
"F::That guy?"
"K::Call the gangs."
"F::He has it? 
Well good look finding him."
"K::With my luck he'll shoot himself up with it, or sell it to a junkie"
"F::Wait - what did you steal?"
"K::A syringe...
That they were giving out"
"F::And a homeless man has it now?"
~A silence fell over them~
"F::We should find that man"
"K::Got any nifty tricks to do that?"
*Felix reached out his hand for his phone*
"F::A few"
