There exists a language that doesn't process through our Wernicke's area:
instead it processes a more fundemental level.
this language is both spoken and written. 
the written language it is a collection of movement and shapes.
this language can overwrite memory... and worse...
it can cause any arbitrary chemical change in the brain.
abuse or misuse of the language is an easy death sentence.

## the-back-of-the-mind

the back of the mind is the location created by the shared consiousness of life.
it exists as set of connected ideas and thoughts, where moving through that space is emotional - not spacial. 
there exists islands of solid dream inside the back of the mind...
Alacira's ship, and places she collection for example...


## namshubs
a packet of information exchanged through the link.
it is not seen or heard, bypassing both senses to go directly to the brain.

### hooks
an example of an implanted namshub: the most common.
uses .$method(($parameters)?<=$trigger=>$source)
parameters trigger and source are optional.
default parameters are ~self~.
default trigger is ~all~
default source is ~self~
    hooks.follow(~self~)<="heel"=>~self~
    is the same as
    hooks.follow()<="heel"
    

## the-link
a psychic link between all living things.
humans are only aware of human thoughts.
people asleep 'run' the back of the mind through the link.
all living things sleeping run a part of the back of the mind.

## algera
the substance that allows for the psychic link.
a substance attracted not to gravity - but high order entropy.
higher ordered, unique, rare information collects raw algera.
every mind is lightly dusted with the stuff.
reality walkers use a refined form of that algera.
refined algera is created from destroying the matter to which it clings.


## reality-walkers

only a few people know of them.
they may smuggle or trade through various realites.
they may suggest...
some say they have a reality of their own:
and island timeline surrounded by waves of destruction.
