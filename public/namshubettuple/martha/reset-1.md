"M::So I'm basically crazy"
'R::No your reality is just a bit realigned'
"M::That's what crazy is!"
~And a moment later, and a bit quieter~
"M::I'm not crazy."
~Her hands felt sticky, they had been on her vest~
}
{
'R::Go ahead, push me out of the chair, and see for yourself'
~She did: not with any grace, or particular speed~
~But with a deep well of rage hidden deep below a murky still pond~
*He fell backwards, knocking his head against the wall*
~Leaving an indent in the plaster~
*The chair fell with him as he groped at his head*
*She used the opportunity to walk out of the side dining area through the backyard door*
~It felt real to her~
~Her vest, she didn't wear a vest at work~
}
{
*She walked out the door with two possibilities in her head*
`[*She had a nervous breakdown* => *Killed someone and imagined a surreal conversation*, 
~She was drugged and kidnapped by a crazed charlatan~,
~The was real~,
*She was in the link now*
]`
~She was acutely aware in a way she never was before about the structure of her own thoughts~
~As if she could feel a physical place where they fit in her brain~
~And just like that, as the bright moonlight hit her~
}
{
"M::Fuck, it's night."
~It was a bright light in the sky, but no - not the moon~
~It was a bubble, decending~
*She walked more determinedly*
~Forcing each foot to the ground as a stop-measure against her rising panic~
}
{
~She was in the backyard~
~A lush and wet lawn spanning what looked like an acre, surrounded by trees... 
She went around the corner as Rossin stepped out of the door behind her~
*He walked lazily down the steps, letting the door bang behind him*
~Martha remembered this before, a jolting de-javue~
"A::Reel her in!" 
~She felt a tugging on her vest~
~The rope behind her split into every fiber of her memory~
~A spiderweb, tugging at each edge, all encompassing her view~
~Pulling on each blade of grass, each part of her memory~
~The unique sensation of being ripped inside out~
~Martha found herself on the floor of the bubble~
*She took in a few breaths*
"M::Okay -the exit is up that way"

}
{
~Alacria shuffeled~
"A::If we don't go through soon, she'll land right back in"
"A::It's right below us, and catching up."    
*Martha looked down below*
~She saw herself, as herself, and from above~
~Though the above view was fading~
}
{
~She went around the corner as Rossin stepped out of the door behind her~
*He walked lazily down the steps, letting the door bang behind him*
"M::You're following me now?"
*He shifted his tie, adjusted his hat now that it was on him*
'R::Well, I am in your head, you put two and two together.'
*Leaving him behind she walked past the side of the… mansion… yes it was a mansion*
~Complete with a ridiculously long driveway and hedges blocking all surrounding views~
*She continued out to the street, Rossin making his way behind her*
'R::There is more.'
*He paused once he caught up*
"M::I just pushed you out of a chair! 
You're real."
}
{
~He said nothing when they got past the hedges onto the street~
~Nor did he speak while on the pavement of the long narrow street with no lights~
~They walked in silence for a time~
~Each footfall kept her in the here and now~
~Determined not to think of where she was, or where she was going~
`['Just walking',
'One foot in front of the other, one step at a time.'
'Eventually things will pass.']`
~She heard her steps in sync with Rossin's~
~In the distance, a pale blue light rounded the corner of the street~
}
{
*Rossin covered his lips with a single finger, then his whole hand*
*And then he did a small skip and danced into the middle of the road*
~Just in time for the car, not having slowed down at all, to hit him~
*He folded under the hood and rolled underneath the tires*
*Martha count three and a half rolls*
*Some rational part of her brain managed to keep count*
*Pulling him down and under as the car hobbled over him*
*He rolled a few times on the pavement before laying motionless*
*The car drove into the distance*
*Martha rushed over into the middle of the street where his body lay*
*She tried to brush her hair out of her face, to tuck it behind her ear*
*She missed*
*Her hand was shaking*
~She never saw a car crash up close~
*A voice behind her called out, from where she had just been*
'R::Am I real?'
*Rossin, without a scratch on him, dusted off his sleeve*
'R::I really would like to know a definitive answer to that'
~She a double take: the body she had just been leaning over was gone~
'R::But you most probably are, so would you get out of the street.'
}
{
*Martha stood up and continued walking*
~What else could she do?~
~To stop and consider would be to invite madness~
~No~
~She needed to get home~
*She tried to tuck her hair behind her ear and failed again*
~Her hand was still shaking~
*She breathed and steadied it*
~And tried again: again she failed~
}
{
'R::Oh... 
Right... 
There are more than just memories missing... 
That thing latched on to a few other parts of your brain. 
Some of your proprioception is missing...'
*Rossin joined her by her side*
"M::My what?"
'R::Your ability to instinctively know distances, particularly to your ear. 
You need a mirror to understand that distance...
You need to be able to see it,
On a related note...'
~Thoughts - injected into her~
~It was a list~
*^Martha gasped and grabbed at her eye*
`(~Quarantined~)=>[ 
Smell(~Oranges~), 
Sight(~Magenta~), 
Taste(~Copper~), 
Touch(~Ice~), 
Proprioception(~Right-pinky~ => ~Left-toe~]*EOLERR*("WrongLEN.Internal_...")^`
"M::What was that?"
*Rossin raised his hands - spreading his palms out*
'R::Right, I lost some things too. 
It tried to grab a hold of me while I was in your head'
*Rossin lowered his hands, and walked a bit closer*
'R::There are some sharp corners of the parts missing.'
"M::What did you lose?"
'R::If I remember, then I have not lost them...'
}
{
~They walked in silence for a time~
~Martha attempted to exercise the ghost of a pain forgotten by rubbing at her eye~
~It was mildly successful~
'R::It may be dormant, but it is not gone...
I just took out the internal triggers. 
Its backup plan if it got removed... 
But Martha, there is more... 
I mean of them... 
I mean... 
External triggers.
There are symbols or expressions that will activate that thing in your brain.
Anyone who has read what you have read... 
They make the same marks to retrigger anyone who has seen the original. 
This kind of attack is not uncommon in the higher circles of society.
Secret - not talked about... but common.
You would only be at risk of that particular hook.'
"M::So you're saying there's a mark or a symbol.
And if I look at this mark or symbol: will make me an insane monster literally.
Which will then kill itself and thus me?"
'R::...Basically.'
"M::Anything else? If I'm going insane, I might as well know what I'm in for."
'R::I can teach you, we will start with:'
`hooks=>(~Reaction definitions~)`
'R::...and a few other basics, some history, and if you are exposed to a different'
`namshub=>(~Pieces of language that program~)`
'R::I can catch it, but it is destructive in nature... 
It literally kills me to do so, no help with the hooks already in you though.'
}
{
'M::So what? 
Was he to be that helpful little paperclip in the speech center of my brain?'
`['Is he real?', 
'Is he what he says he is?', 
'Can she get rid of him?', 
'Should she get rid of him?']`
~Again, she felt a distinct awareness in her brain on the ordering of her thoughts~
*She shook her head clear and said*
"M::Are you a virus, or a program?"
'R::I am a tuple. 
But if you are asking if you can exorcise me from your head, then yes.
I will go freely.
But then you will likely go to prison for that murder, or you can learn from me. 
Join the society that controls everything at the deepest levels.'
*Rossin turned to her*
'R::And help my author bring it all down.'
