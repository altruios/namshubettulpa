~The fuzzy carpet broke into a kaleidoscope of color in between the resounding pain~
*Martha opened her eyes, aware vaguely that she was on the floor*
~The agony came in waves, erasing her vision, her hearing~
~And it replaced both with a ringing~
~A sharp oscillation between feeling nothing and feeling everything at once~
~A universal frequency she thought of as the universal frequency of pain~
~If she could scream, she would~
~Maybe she was: if she could find her voice among the ringing, she wasn't sure~
~Time ceased~
~With the only hints of it passing being the up and down of that oscillation~
~Slowly it subsided~
'R::One more pull, I think that would be all of it'
~A voice echoing in the distance, one so familiar, she could almost remember~
~And the pain plunged her experience,  nothing but this ringing pain~
~A totality of existence~

~An unknowable amount of time passed, and then the pain subsided~
~Feeling crept along her extremities, a white hot prickling fire that ran through her skin~
~The carpet was still multicolored and sharp~
~As if she saw the edge of each individual atom, and how they interlocked~
~In time the carpet returned to a bland silvery wool~
*It was fuzzy under her hand as she lifted herself up*
~Everything was either grey or white in the room she was in~
~A crystal chandelier overhung what appeared to be the entrance off to her left~
~Underneath was a marble staircase casting dark shadows through the moonlight~
~A beam of yellow light emanating from her right~
*She turned her head that way.*
