{
*Martha stood up and continued walking*
~What else could she do?~
~To stop and consider would be to invite madness~
~No~
~She needed to get home~
*She tried to tuck her hair behind her ear and failed again*
~Her hand was still shaking~
*She breathed and steadied it*
~And tried again: again she failed~
}
{
'R::Oh... 
Right... 
There are more than just memories missing... 
That thing latched on to a few other parts of your brain. 
Some of your proprioception is missing...'
*Rossin joined her by her side*
"M::My what?"
'R::Your ability to instinctively know distances, particularly to your ear. 
You need a mirror to understand that distance...
You need to be able to see it,
On a related note...'
~Thoughts - injected into her~
~It was a list~
*^Martha gasped and grabbed at her eye*
`(~Quarantined~)=>[ 
Smell(~Oranges~), 
Sight(~Magenta~), 
Taste(~Copper~), 
Touch(~Ice~), 
Proprioception(~Right-pinky~ => ~Left-toe~]*EOLERR*("WrongLEN.Internal_...")^`
"M::What was that?"
*Rossin raised his hands - spreading his palms out*
'R::Right, I lost some things too. 
It tried to grab a hold of me while I was in your head'
*Rossin lowered his hands, and walked a bit closer*
'R::There are some sharp corners of the parts missing.'
"M::What did you lose?"
'R::If I remember, then I have not lost them...'
}
{
~They walked in silence for a time~
~Martha attempted to exercise the ghost of a pain forgotten by rubbing at her eye~
~It was mildly successful~
'R::It may be dormant, but it is not gone...
I just took out the internal triggers. 
Its backup plan if it got removed... 
But Martha, there is more... 
I mean of them... 
I mean... 
External triggers.
There are symbols or expressions that will activate that thing in your brain.
Anyone who has read what you have read... 
They make the same marks to retrigger anyone who has seen the original. 
This kind of attack is not uncommon in the higher circles of society.
Secret - not talked about... but common.
You would only be at risk of that particular hook.'
"M::So you're saying there's a mark or a symbol.
And if I look at this mark or symbol: will make me an insane monster literally.
Which will then kill itself and thus me?"
'R::...Basically.'
"M::Anything else? If I'm going insane, I might as well know what I'm in for."
'R::I can teach you, we will start with:'
`hooks=>(~Reaction definitions~)`
'R::...and a few other basics, some history, and if you are exposed to a different'
`namshub=>(~Pieces of language that program~)`
'R::I can catch it, but it is destructive in nature... 
It literally kills me to do so, no help with the hooks already in you though.'
}
{
'M::So what? 
Was he to be that helpful little paperclip in the speech center of my brain?'
`['Is he real?', 
'Is he what he says he is?', 
'Can she get rid of him?', 
'Should she get rid of him?']`
~Again, she felt a distinct awareness in her brain on the ordering of her thoughts~
*She shook her head clear and said*
"M::Are you a virus, or a program?"
'R::I am a tuple. 
But if you are asking if you can exorcise me from your head, then yes.
I will go freely.
But then you will likely go to prison for that murder, or you can learn from me. 
Join the society that controls everything at the deepest levels.'
*Rossin turned to her*
'R::And help my author bring it all down.'
