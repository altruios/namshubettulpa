# VOWS
{
~Kent sat in the waiting room.~
~Nurses bustling about~
~A chorus of beeps from machines lay in the distance beyond a set of doors.~
~Above him an angry news anchor~
~Complaining about something Kent didn’t care about or listen to.~
~A chorus of low murmurs and coughs filled out the white noise.~
~His eyes were heavy, and he held his head in his hands, resting them.~
~He found a ledge for his head to lean back - and drifted off to sleep.~
~He awoke suddenly to his name being called.~
~A nurse at the double doors looked at him expectantly.~
*A yawn later he was up, and followed the nurse a few paces behind.*
*He looked at the clock they passed.*
'A few minutes of sleep was worse than none,'
~But he had been here for hours already.~
"You can see him, but he’s not awake yet."
*The nurse turned a corner.*
"How bad was it?"
"He got skin grafts, on his right side...  
His lungs are fine - minimal smoke damage.
A contusion on the back of his head... 
And a broken finger: from when he fell. 
He’s stable but unconscious."
*Kent nodded and the nurse stopped* 
~They stood in front of a sliding glass door with curtains beyond.~
"When do you think he’ll wake?"
"Hard to say."
*The nurse slid open the door.*
"He’s not in a coma - just...
Asleep."
"What’s the difference?"
"Coma there’s no rem cycle.
He’s got rapid eye movement - means he’s dreaming...
Means he should be able to wake up."
}
{
*Kent walked in.*
~Tom was wrapped in bandages, his head exposed.~
~His left hand in a small device to keep the fingers straight.~
~Wires connected him to a machine on his right~
~They monitoring a heart rate and other things.~
"So he’s stable?"
"He’s not going to die, not today at least."
*Kent swallowed.*
~Even with the bandages there Kent saw the black and red flesh beneath...~
~He reminded himself that it was covered in fake skin below that bandage~
~And then his imagination ran wild with lizard skin imagery.~
~He suppressed a gag.~
"And the other one?"
"We couldn’t revive him.
He died in the ambulance."
*Kent nodded, then looked back to Tom.*
}
{
"Hey Bozo: you ready to wake up?"
~The reaction was immediate - the heart monitor rate spiked.~
*Tom’s eyes fluttered open.*
*The nurse went to his bedside when he started writhing in pain.*
*They pressed some buttons on the machine and a hiss escaped.*
~Some liquid pumped into Tom’s IV and Tom stopped struggling.~
~His heart rate decreasing.~
~Kent only watched.~
"It's so warm,"
~Tom said, his voice a little raspy.~
"You burned yourself pretty bad, what were you doing?"
"Burned?"
*Tom tried to sit up*
~Tried.~
}
{
~The drugs they pumped him with dulled the pain, partially...~
"How did I get here...
What happened?"
~His eyes were glassy now - not fully able to focus on Kent.~
"You were in that room. 
With the tech - you lit the tapes on fire.  
You covered the emergency sprinkler with your jacket 
You nearly burned the station down."
*Tom started scratching at his arm - where the IV was.*
"I did?"
~He paused.~
"No I didn’t...
Why would I do that? That’s crazy."
"I saw you do it, the whole station saw you do it.
I want to know why?"
"I just brought you coffee - and now I’m here."
~Tom said.~
}
{
*Tom moved his arm, the one connected to the IV, toward the nurse.*
"Should this itch?"
*The nurse shook her head.*
"It really itches"
*Tom started wheezing.*
~The beeping of the machine grew more frequent.~
*The nurse pushed a button on the side.*
}
{
"Sir, you’re going to have to leave?"
"What’s going on?"
"Allergic reaction maybe - I just called the doctor."
~And no sooner than she said it several people filled the room.~
~They carried other machinery. ~
~Kent assumed one to be a crash cart...~
~The other's he didn't recognize.~
*Tom’s wheezing grew louder as the beeping grew more frequent.*
}
{
*Kent backed out of the room followed by the nurse before they shut the door.*
~They then  guided him to the waiting room, to wait...~
~...again.~
*Kent sat back down in the chair he was in before.*
~He listened to the drone of mumbles and whispers from the others in the room.~
*He closed his eyes,*~ and tried to relax to find sleep.~
~He could not.~
~His mind replayed the event over and over, not perfectly.~
~The charred black and red skin intermixed between the images.~
~He tried to filter those out but found he could not.~
}
{
~The last moment was the woman,~
'Martha,'
~Speaking that strange language.~
'Had she done this somehow?'
'If so...'
'How?'
~He struggled for a reason...~ 
~Any reason Tom might help the tech destroy those tapes.~
~Or why the tech ran and grabbed Martha’s file.~
'It was as if he was hypnotised - but that was nonsense.'
'Hypnosis wasn’t real - something for stage shows and bad TV.'
~Neither of which he’s seen personally...~
~But everyone loved to talk about bad TV.~
*He repeatedly scratched at the back of his head.*
*His fingers going back over the bump.*
'Tom would be fine...'
'He was in a hospital...'
'And he had been stable'
'And they knew exactly what they put into him, so they’d be able to fix it...'
~He told himself that - but the nurse’s eyes.~
~The sudden concern in those eyes juxtaposed against that last thought.~
~He tried to focus on something, anything else.~
~...And there wasn’t a better distraction than his job.~
~He held his head in his hands, his arms braced against the chair~
~He was so tired, too much had happened in one day.~
~He replayed the events leading up to the fire.~
}
{
~He couldn’t shake the thought.~ 
'Something in that tape they watched caused this.'
~Something Martha had done...~
~And she was missing.~
'And those other people in the cell with her were...'
~Also hypnotised he realized.~
~She had spoken the same indescribable language to them too...~
}
{
'She tried that on me,'
~He realized...~
'And it didn’t work...
Did it?
How would I even know one way or the other?'
*He flexed his hands...*
~He felt like he was in control~
~Some small part of him couldn’t help but doubt.~
*His eyes twitched with a rapid double vision, he tried to focus them again.*
~His sleep deprivation, maybe that was adding to his paranoia.~
~He couldn’t explain what had happened.~
~But he knew Martha was at the center of it - somehow he knew that.~
~A deep sense of dread filled his gut as he realized he was out of his depth.~
~He ran these thoughts over and over in his head.~
~He did come to any new conclusions - but further solidifying one fact.~
~He had to find Martha.~
~Make her explain.~
~Make her answer for what she had done...~
~Though he was not even sure exactly of what she did.~
~An hour or so later, he heard his name called again.~
~It was the same nurse: she wore the face of someone bearing tragic news.~
*Kent lowered his head into his hands and tears rolled out against his wishes.*
*He got up - and followed her back through the double doors.*
}
{
%%%%
}
{
~Martha held on to the dream as best she could.~
*As she rinsed out her mouth at the sink.*
~She got a good 4 hours later, Rossin nowhere to be found.~
*Martha splashed her face - trying to drive the sleep away.*
}
{
~She saw something on her elbow, a scab that looked fresh.~
*She rubbed at it.*
'Was it...
From the dream?'
~She wondered.~
~Bits more came back to her.~
~She recoiled at the thought of going back to sleep. ~
~As tired as she was, she was worried she would have another nightmare.~
'What exactly happened?'
~She remembered Jason Vorheeves, the ship...~
~And the book.~
~The image of that symbol flashed in her memory.~
~An undulating pattern that rotated in on itself~
~It left an afterimage of itself in her mind’s eye.~
}
{
~That pattern had been a language - one she could almost understand.~
~Not in words, not in feelings, but in something just beyond her grasp.~
~Every detail of that twisting pattern burned in her mind.~
*She drank some water to try and help with the headache.*
~Either it was lack of sleep or it was that image, she couldn’t tell.~
*She looked up at the mirror in front of her* 
*Rossin stood behind her, she whirled.*
"Where were you?"
"Asleep it would seem"
*Rossin looked around the room.*
"You haven’t been asleep all that long - apparently I still needed some."
*Martha turned back to the mirror, swallowing more water.*
"Any dreams"
"A dreamless sleep, you?"
"Nightmare...
Well."
~Martha started.~
"Maybe something more"
*Rossin tilted his head.*
"I think...
I don’t know if I was in the back of the mind, the link...
Whatever it is...
But there was a captain, in a storm. 
And an Italian monastery with a romance novel that had some symbol on it."
~Rossin interrupted.~
"What symbol"
*Martha shook her head,*
"It twists, undulates...
I can still see it."
*Rossin tapped his fingers at his side.*
"Well, this actually directs our first lesson...
I want to see that - which means you need to learn some basic syntax. 
How to send and receive data through the link."
"You’re in my brain, can’t you just...
See it?"
"I may be in your brain, but I’m not in your mind. 
My mind sharing this brain with you, I didn’t see anything in any dream. 
So you’d have to send it to me...
I can’t read your mind, remember?"
*Rossin said as he walked off.*
"I’ll be over here when you’re ready"
"Ready?"
"I assume you want to take a shower - you should. 
You kind of look like shit... 
Like you’ve been up all night and dramatized by a whole lot.
Go relax with some hot water."
~She did need a bath...~ 
~But she really hadn’t considered what that would be like with a...~
'Sentient brain she couldn’t really get rid of...'
~Martha thought, he was in her head, so...~
`['Was he bathing with her?',
'Or was he in the other room...'
'Or by going to the other room was that a different part of her mind?']`
"Fine, but stay in that room."
"Won’t look in, I’m not interested in that, just don’t be too long."
*Rossin walked out of the bathroom and she shut the door.*
*She turned on the faucet to the tub.*
~For a moment she watched the water rushing out~ 
~Swirling into the tub in chaotic waves.~
}
{
*She closed her eyes.*
'What did she need to do?'
`['Find out if that dream was real', 
'Find out about that symbol', 
'Train with Rossin', 
'Get Felix to take her to new york', 
'Fix those other people in the cell she was in', 
'Kill that thing in my brain’, 
‘Have a good fucking meal', 
'Fix the world']`
~She paused.~
~The ordering of her thoughts startled her.~
~Clear as day despite how tired she still was.~
~Normally she had trouble focusing, but it was easy now.~
~Simply a list - one that she realized - would remain easily recallable.~
'That’s handy - grocery shopping would be easy...'
~She wondered how far she could stretch that?~
~How would she test that?~
*When the water was half full she moved back to the room.*
*Rossin sat on the bed.*
*His head turned quizzically when she reached in the drawer beside her.*
'Yep.'
~There was a bible - even in a seedy motel.~
"Some light bath reading?"
"Some testing, random phrases"
"Ah...
So you have lists?"
~Martha paused, considering.~
"That’s probably it"
*Rossin nodded.*
"You don’t have infinite space, infinite resources in your brain. 
Don’t fill too much with junk."
*Martha nodded.*
*Walking back into the restroom before closing the door.*
*She turned off the water and disrobed, she hadn’t any other clothes, so...*
'Eh, close enough'
~At least she could clean herself.~
*Dipping in the bath she opened the bible to random pages* 
~She glanced at a few passages.~
~Each stuck in her mind - added to a list.~
*She did this for a few minutes and then closed the book - then her eyes.*
*Holding her nose she dipped below the water.*
~When she was done - dried and clothed again, she recalled the list.~
~Each item was perfectly remembered - or so she thought~
*She moved out into the other room* 
*Martha grabbed a small pencil and notepad by the phone.*
*She wrote out passages - word for word.*
~When she was done - she compared them to the book - all perfectly remembered.~
"So what, I have a perfect memory?"
"Well, no.
Just about things you decide to remember - and not exactly perfectly...
Lets just say...
Resilient, not subject to your memory rewriting"
"Is that something you did?"
*He paused, nodded.*
"There are some...
Liberties I took - before getting that thing completely out.
A bit of house keeping"
~Martha waited and Rossing continued.~
"Well, there’s some...
Rewiring I did...
Things it would take years to learn - you would just need to learn how to do. 
You wouldn’t need to train for years to prepare your mind. 
You have a mind prepared to learn."
"I see, what exactly did you do, to my brain?"
"Well, I took a lot of the hooks, I can’t know if I got all of them. 
I wired in some senses to emotions. 
I also freed a bit of space - sort of a sandbox for you to write into..."
"I got the first part, but...
What do you mean about senses to emotions?"
"Okay, so a strong emotional reactions increased some other sense as well.
Anger is vision, loneliness is taste, joy is touch. 
Fear is your perception of time - your thoughts run faster.
You can’t move any faster but you can think way faster. 
The other ones are more or less arbitrary.
But slowing down time when you’re frightened is super useful"
*Martha stared at him, and he continued,*
"Emotional training is something everyone at the school is taught. 
How to manipulate your own emotions - master them. 
So that you can use them to trigger various sense enhancements."
"Uh-huh."
~Martha said blankly.~
"And the other thing?"
"Ah, writing into your brain.
So you can learn the language"
"Which language?"
"The language!"
~Rossin exclaimed, ~
"The one behind all other languages. 
The one we all think as an infant. 
Before we learn what words are or the language our parents taught us.
The one you thought in before you learned how to speak."
"So baby talk?"
"Don’t be daft, babies think it, but can’t speak it"
}
{
~Martha just nodded, sure, why not at this point.~
"And how is space in my brain going to help me learn?"
*Rossin gestured to the bed next to him,*
"Here, sit down, and when you’re ready, close your eyes."
*Martha moved to the bed and shut her eyes.*
"Okay...
So - imagine your vision is in front of you,"
"It is in front of me"
"I mean like a screen, imagine you are looking at a screen, right"
"And it's in front of me,"
"Aye, your field of vision. 
Imagine you are a little dot - looking at that screen. 
Right now it’s black - that’s all you can see."
~Rossin sighed.~
"This isn’t very easy to explain, you are going to look to your left. 
Not with your vision, but at that point where you are looking at your vision. 
Shift your focus to the left of your vision - it’ll be a blank wall."
~Martha tried to do that...~
"I just see darkness, I don’t know"
*She opened her eyes, and looked to the right: to where Rossin was.*
"How do I know when I’ve done it"
*Rossin gestured for her to close her eyes.*
*She did.*
"It’ll be apparent - just relax and focus.
Your vision is just part of your brain. 
Lighting up from some chemical signals from your eyes. 
You are focused on that when you see. 
Just - with your eyes close: focus to your left. 
Pivot your attention away from where you see."
~Martha tried for a bit.~
~A few minutes passed~  
~She was pretty sure she was just trying to look left with her eyes.~
~No matter how she tried she wasn’t able to just...~
~Turn her brain like that, was that the best phrase, she wondered.~
'Turn my brain....'
~Eventually - with her eyes closed - she allowed her mind to wander.~
~She was in a motel room trying to look left and...~
~A flash of white appeared, and was gone.~
~Just a hair bit out of her vision.~
~It wasn’t in front of her eyes but to the left side of her head...~ 
~And she could see it.~
~A blinking, white light, rectangular in shape, pulsing evenly.~
"I think I found something?"
}
{
"What is it?"
"A blinking rectangle"
~Words underneath the blinking rectangle, as the shape moved to the right.~
~It was a cursor.~
~It continued to the right, then shifted to a new line.~
}
{
`"Hello Martha, say apple"`
"It’s telling me to say apple?"
"I can write on it. 
Martha - think of this as a message board. 
We’re both able to read it."
*Martha opened her eyes.*
~Her consciousness shifted to the right in a sudden lurch~ 
~She saw the motel room again.~
~The light hurt her eyes, how long had they been closed.~
*She squinted.*
"It’s alright, you’re alright."
~Rossin said reassuringly, she realized she was shaking~
*Martha stilled herself.*
"Next time look back where your vision is - less disorienting that way."
~A headache, sudden and painful, Martha held her head.~
"It’ll pass, soon."
~And as suddenly as it had come, Martha was fine.~
"You'll better at moving your focus point internally. 
You’ll be able to do that with your eyes open just fine. 
For now though, keep your eyes closed - and the same way you turned, just...
Turn back the other way."
}
{
~For the next hour that’s all Martha did.~ 
~She looked back and forth between her vision, and that text to her left.~
`['Was look even the right word if she wasn’t using her eyes?',
'Was there a right word?']`
"Rossin, is there a...
Word for this - what i’m doing.
I’m not looking to my left - I’m not using my eyes"
"Inter-seeing, is the definition. 
There are other places you can look. 
There’s not much there - and I wouldn’t go poking around...
You still have...
That thing inside you, what’s left of it anyway...
Best not to accidentally look at it."
"But the left is safe?"
"The left is safe, I built that myself.
Fancy, no?"
"It’s just text"
*Rossin waved dismissively*
"You wouldn’t yet understand, it’s in your language. 
Access to your brain, in your own language. 
Not the brain's language, yours...
That’s fancy"
"It’s fancy - not colorful, decorative, or initially impressive...
But fancy I’ll grant you"
~Rossin grumbled.~
"The fancy part you haven’t seen yet."
"Oh?"
"Well, we need another human - and you’re not ready for that yet...
But..."
~He sighed.~
"Might as well tell you now - you can write hooks on that board. 
Execute them - and then your brain will just...
Do them for you, baby steps in actually learning how to speak hooks yourself...
Without the aid of that translator - that’s what it is, a fancy translator"
}
{
"So I can...
Just write anything"
"Anything yes...
As long as you spell it out exactly you can write what you want down. 
As long as it makes sense to you. 
And it means exactly one thing...
No wiggle room...
The closer it is to what your brain wants: the less likely something is to...
Go wrong - or be misinterpreted"
"Right.
That’s...
Useful - and I think impressive - I don’t really have a frame of reference"
}
{
*Rossin sighed, *
"You know how Felix had that phone: flashing in front of your neighbor’s face? 
That’s how most of the Awakened use hooks. 
They have a special image that hooks them into doing what they want.
He had a general ‘follow my verbal commands one’ on his phone. 
He didn’t just say those hooks because he probably can’t...
It’s not something they teach anymore."
~Martha looked at him~
"And you’re teaching me?"
"Trying to at least...
I’m not exactly designed to teach - I’m doing the best I can here."
"You’re doing fine - it’s probably not easy being in someone else’s head."
*Martha patted him on the back, surprised that he felt physical.*
"You haven’t the slightest idea."
*Rossin said, standing up.*
}
{
"We’ve been at this long enough, and we have places to be yet."
*Martha’s stomach growled.*
~She had been ignoring that - everything taking a higher priority.~
"I need to eat."
"When was the...
Right - you haven’t eaten since I was here...
So...
Aye - good time to mention you’re going to need more calories...
Your brain is using more calories than usual... 
Will be using more calories overall...
You should get used to eating...
A fair bit more"
"What’s a fair bit more?"
"An extra couple of meals a day...
Good big meals."
~Rossin said.~
"After we get you fed we should go take care of those cellmates of yours, yes?"
}
{
*Martha nodded.*
~She hadn’t forgotten - the list of things to do was always there. 
Just off to the right of her mind.~
~Cataloged with others, like a rolodex - indexable.~
"But food first."
~Rossin waited at the door.~
