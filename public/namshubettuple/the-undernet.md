# THE UNDERENET
{
~Martha sat in one of the chairs in a row facing the luggage dispenser.~
~Felix still had not shown up, and neither had Rossin.~
~She recounted her dream.~
~Lists she made while in the dream were still just as fresh as any other.~
~She closed her eyes - her message still written off to her left,~
`['Had another dream',
'That police officer was in it',
'Sort of....'
'How can I wake you?']`
*She tapped her foot ideally, watching the luggage getting picked up.*
~The people moved like ants.~
~A rhythm each individual wasn’t aware of, but any outside observer was.~
~She fell deeper into her thoughts...~
'Where were they?'
~It had been already an hour since she landed.~
~A small moment of panic hit her, she was stranded - in New York.~
`['With no real money.'
'Left here',
'Maybe Felix already left', 
'Maybe Rossin would not wake up...',
'Maybe...']`
~She didn't write this list to the board.~
~she would have kept going except she heard a noise to her left.~
*Rossin sat down next to her.*
*She turned to him.*
"What took you so long?"
~She asked.~
"I enjoy my beauty sleep"
~He said flippantly.~ 
*He yawned and looked around.*
"I don’t exactly have a choice in that...
How long?"
"About an hour."
~She said.~
"He’s still a no show..."
*Rossin nodded,*
"That’s to be expected - he’s probably eating now...
Which by the way: why aren’t you doing?"
"I had a snack"
"A snack?"
"A little power bar - dense calories"
~Rossin scoffed,~
"One ‘little’ power bar...
You need more...
Much more,"
*He sat up.*
"Come on,"
~He said,~
"We’re getting you more food."
*She got up and matched his pace.*
"So...
Another dream?"
~He finally asked.~
*Martah nodded.*
"I remember more of it now. 
I think they, I don’t know, pulled me out of mine and into theirs.
Captain Alacira was her name"
*Rossin hesitated every so slightly in his step* 
~He regained his composure a moment later~
"Ah...
Her.
I - my author hasn’t heard from the likes of her since, well...
Before you were born.
About 40 years now"
"Wait...
You know her?"
"My author did...
Long ago...
She was a console member...
Still is, technically, since she’s alive...
What has she been doing?"
~He mused to himself.~
*He looked back to her,*
"What exactly was she doing?"
"Well..."
~Martha started, gathering her thoughts.~
"She was sending me places...
First an old italian monastery, then some weird place with a bunch of gears...
I was finding things for her.
And they made these - patterns. 
These shapes in my brain - I still see them."
"I see...
And can you put these patterns on that board to your left?"
~She tried to fit those shapes into a list, but they refused.~
~Bulging out from that boundary...~
~Shattering the well-ordering of her thoughts...~
~No matter what she tried - they refused to be put inside.~
~And since she hadn’t learned how to put anything but lists...~
~She tried just without the lists and to her surprise, it worked...~
//(IMAGE LINKS GO HERE)
~They exploded out of the board to the left of her perception.~
~Fading into nothing - they were still burned into her brain, but that had...~
~Hurt - she had a splitting headache.~
"Oh...
That’s what she’s after."
"What?"
~Martha asked through gritted teeth.~
"Are you alright, did that hurt?"
"Yes...
My head is pounding."
~Everything was too bright, the sounds were too loud.~
*She closed her eyes and covered her ears.*
*She pressed on her forehead to quell the throbbing.*
~She had migraines before - but this was something else, something worse.~
*She opened her eyes and her vision swam.*
*Panting she stumbled toward a wall, and slid down it.*
*Closing her eyes she focused on her breathing.*
~Things grew more quiet and she could finally make out Rossin talking to her.~
~She couldn’t hear him, interrupting she said:~
"...just - be quiet for a second...
I’m getting better just - hold on for a minute."
~He didn’t wait a whole minute - but he did wait a few seconds,~
"Felix is here, he’s walking toward you - stand up if you can."
*She opened her eyes...*
~Her vision swam.~
~Corners had extra shadows that danced and stretched...~
~It was getting better, but slowly.~
"I hope you got a good look - I’m not doing that again"
*She braced against the wall and slid up.*
*Felix came into her vision from around the corner.*
~He was holding two ice cream cones, one of which he was licking.~
~He spoke as he approached,~
"You look like shit, good thing I have ice cream"
"Bad sleep, hardly any actually,"
*She said - taking the cone.*
~It was mint-chip.~
~Not her favorite, by a long shot~
`>>--ST -o --auto`
*She took a small bite*
~But the flavor exploded in her mouth.~
*She started consuming chunks of it.*
~She didn’t realize how famished she was.~
'And this is the best damn icecream'
~She realized as she licked at it.~
"I assumed you would get food too. 
This was desert, were you waiting all this time?"
*Martha nodded.*
~Her vision was slowly but surely coming back to normal.~
~And a slow cold swelled in the top of her mouth.~
~She didn’t care, it was just so - damn - good.~
~It helped with the headache - something to distract from it.~
~A new pain, harmonizing and smoothing out the sharper pain in her brain~
"We’ll walk then, it’s not far - grab something on the way."
*He held out his arm Martha linked with it.*

~Behind them Kent watched them link arms.~
~He wasn’t in ear shot so he just followed them.~
~They were walking apparently to wherever they were heading.~
~Which was a stroke of luck for him, not having to hail down a taxi...~
~He watched them stop at a hotdog vendor.~
~Felix flashing his phone and the vendor just giving them several hotdogs.~
~They walked off without paying.~
*He stopped himself, to meet the vendor’s glassy stare.*
~It took a few seconds but suddenly he shook and asked what Kent wanted.~
*Kent paid for a hotdog and hurriedly caught up.*
~They entered Idlewild Park and made their way up Brookville blvd.~
~They walked for some time until they stopped at a building...~
~Incongruent with the rest.~
~It was tall.~
~30 stories high when everything around it was nearly flat.~
~It was black.~
~And at the top it had symbols on it - stark white against the obsidian.~
~That’s what it looked like on the outside...~
~Black glass.~
~Impermeable by light.~
*Felix and Martha went inside.*
*Kent started to follow, but slowed.*
~The building was so out of place, and those symbols...~
~They were almost like the one’s Felix had shown him on his phone.~
'Were they there so people ‘forgot’ about it when looking at it?' 
~He wondered...~
'Either way...'
~Into the lion's den.~
*Instinctively he padded himself down.*
~Keys, wallet, phone, gun.~
~Hopefully he wouldn’t need the latter~  
~But more and more he was sure he would.~
"This is some bullshit"
~He muttered to himself, stepping up to the building.~
'He was getting to tired for this shit'

"Wait here,"
~Felix said as he Stepped into the dark hallway.~
"Something’s...
Wrong."
~They were on the 4th floor.~
~The elevator just opened to what he promised would be hundreds of peers.~
~Instead they found this...~
*Martha stepped out of the elevator.*
~Waiting at the threshold.~
*Felix opened one of the doors in the hallway.*
~He paused...~
*Closing it again.*
*He walked back.*
"Stay here, I’m going to see if there’s anyone in the building at all."
~Martha nodded and he entered the elevator behind, pushing a few buttons~
"This...
Is strange."
~Rossin said,~
"Come on,"
*He said, waving at her to follow him.*
"I want to know what’s going on."
~She hesitated only a moment - she too wanted to know.~
*Meeting him at the first door, she pushed it open.*
~Behind it - nothing.~
~An empty room with a chalkboard in the distance.~
~Several rows of seats but no humans.~
"Empty"
~She said...~
`(dime: notice something here)`
*She looked down the hallway,*
"Do you hear anything at all?"
"Do you?"
*Martha glared at him then closed her eyes to focus.*
~It was quite enough for her to hear her own heart beat...~
~And something else...~
~A rhythmic knocking, and a scratching - faint...~
~Off to her...~
'To the right: yes, coming from one of the rooms.'
*She moved towards the sound.*
*She reached a door, second on the right and opened it.*
~She was not prepared for what she saw.~
"Oh god."
~Martha said.~
~Behind the door were a row of students, missing their heads...~
~Well, not missing - just misplaced.~
~Differently placed if you will.~
~They sat neatly in rows, as if taking a school photo.~
~They were holding wooden pikes, Balanced against their still bodies.~
~At the top of these pikes made from broken chairs and desks...~
~Were their heads.~
~And seared into their forehead was a letter.~
~They were arranged carefully...~
~Space included to spell out the message:~ 
`~*'UNDERESTIMATED UNDERNET'*~`
*Martha closed the door.*
~But it was too late - details burned into her mind.~
~Their skin - their arms - were puffy and red...~
~Like they were boiled.~
~She noticed a steaming pot on a burner in the back.~
~What did they do in that room, what happened.~
*She gagged a little, the smell wafting over to her finally.*
*She leaned back against the door and started to hyperventilate.*
*Rossin looked at the door, then to her.*
"Undernet..."
~He said.~
"Listen, take a few deep breaths.
Not shallow - that’s how you pass out.
In..."
*He took a breath himself...*
'Did he bre--- no.' 
~Martha thought.~
'He didn’t breath - that was all for show, for her.'
~She followed suit.~
~Rossin breathed out, and she did as well.~
~In the quiet - she heard the scratching - it was coming from that room.~
"Someone’s still in there."
~She said.~
"That’s what that scratching is"
*Rossin nodded.*
"Probably."
~Martha waited, and that’s all he said.~
"So shouldn’t we...
Help them...
Get them out of there?"
~She asked.~
*Rossin shook his head.*
"No one here would do the same for you. 
Whatever is keeping them inside - it’s probably too risky to get them out."
*Martha shook her head.*
*She stood back up and steeled herself.*
"Martha don’t,"
~But it was too late.~
*She entered the room and called out.*
"Hello, is anyone in there."
~She avoided looking at the display of bodies in the center of the room.~
~Closing her eyes, she pinpointed the scratching down - it stopped.~
"Don’t come in!"
~A male voice.~
~Muffled.~
~It came from a supply closet on the left, close to the hallway.~
*She approached.*
"Okay - so he’s warning you not to get closer...
I just want to point this out when things go horribly wrong.
This is your own decision."
~She tried opening the supply closet.~
~It was held fast.~
"Don’t open it, don’t look at me!"
~The voice was frantic, terrified.~
"What happened here?"
~Martha asked.~
~There was a pause.~
~An intake of breath, like he had been sobbing.~
"I killed them - they killed themselves. 
They tried to kill me, I locked myself in here..."
~The voice was pained.~
"I can’t even remember their faces, they’re gone...
Really gone...GET OUT OF MY HEAD"
*He screamed suddenly, a piercing howl.*
~And there was a thumping on the inside of the closet.~
~So violent it almost shook the structure.~
"Martha - you should back away."
~Martha ignored him.~
"I’m going to get you out of there.
Into safety."
"There is none."
~He Squealed.~
"Don’t you understand - it’s in me.
I’m dead...
Worse than dead."
~Rossin spoke up.~
"That thing inside your head...
It’s inside his head too...
Or something like it...
Get out of here now - it’s only a matter of time before..."
~The thumping stopped suddenly.~
"Seriously Martha, now...
Get out of here now!"
*The closet door clicked open.*
*Martha finally started to back away.*
"Faster damn it."
~Rossin was at the door, urging her to move.~
~Her feet felt wooden, the whole moment felt surreal.~
*The door opened.*
*And a young man fell out.*
~His forehead bloody - scratched to hell.~
~His fingers dripped with blood...~
~They had been tearing at a symbol scared into his head.~
~His eyes were wild...~
*He was panting.*
*He crawled on all fours - running at her with an uncanny grace.*
*Martha slammed the door on him - running for the elevator.*
~It did little to slow him down.~
~Whatever he was now - still knew how to work doorknobs.~
*She slammed into the elevator and pressed the down button.*
~Then the up button a moment later.~
*Any direction would do - she turned to face the man.*
~He was on all fours - galloping toward her.~
*She braced herself and jumped to the side just as he reached her.*
*He slammed face first into the elevator.*
*She ran back down the hall.*
"Rossin, can we switch?"
"No time! 
And I don’t think that i would be able to do anything to him anyway"
~There wasn’t much hallway, and that thing was striding towards her now.~
"Duck into one of these rooms, they lock from the inside."
*She grabbed the door...*
~It opened inward.~
*She closed it just in time, and could almost lock the door.*
*The glass broke and his fist came through the now open panel on the door.*
*Martha ducked down - still holding on to the knob.*
*He clawed at her hands.*
~The elevator dinged.~
~And she was able to lock the door.~
~She heard it galloping towards the elevator.~
'Oh shit: Felix...'
~She heard a gunshot, then a thud.~
"Felix?"
*She shouted.*
~Footsteps grew closer, no answer.~
*She started to back away from the door, out of sight.*
*A head poked in, armed raised cautiously with a gun.*
~It was that police officer from her hometown...~
~Martha could see the dark of the barrle, and his finger off of the trigger.~
"What the hell was that, rabies?"
*Martha slowly shook her head, he quickly glanced back toward the elevator.*
"...Zombies?"
~He asked.~
*Again Martha shook her head.*
"Weirder..."
"Weirder than zombies?"
*Again Martha nodded.*
"I’ve had a weird week."
~Sudden relief flooded her.~
~Adrenaline still pumping and she giggled a bit at the absurdity of it all.~
~Stifling that down she sighed.~
"A weird fucking week."
~There was a pause...~
~Kent continued to wait.~
"Are you going to...
Fill me in?"
~He asked, as he inspected his borrowed gun.~
"Do you want to tell me why you’re following me..."
"Well, you broke out of the holding cell. 
No one remembers you, and oh yeah, my friend is dead."
*Kent looked up at her as she turned to Rossin,*
"I told you, we shouldn’t have left yet."
*Rossin shrugged,*
"We can bring him..."
~He trailed off, looking at Kent.~
"Or maybe not...
Maybe we should have stayed..."
"Are you talking to Felix? 
Do you have..."
*He moved his head, peering at her neck.*
"One of those comms under the skin?"
*Rossin went up to Kent, studying him.*
"No...
I’m not, and I don’t"
~Martha said. she was pretty sure under the skin comms was for movies, but...~
"Who are you talking to?"
*Martha lowered her hands slowly, gesturing to his gun*
*Kent lowered his gun*
"...Who are you talking to?"
~He repeated.~
"Well, his name’s Rossin, he’s a non-physical person"
~Rossin perked up at that.~
"I like that,"
~Rossin muttered,~
"Right to the point."
"Non-physical...
So a ghost?"
"More like a...
Memory"
"Isn’t that just a ghost?"
"He’s not made of ectoplasma...
Is that something that exists?"
*She turned to Rossin, who shook his head.*
"Yeah, that’s not even a thing"
"So he’s a memory, like...
In your head"
*Martha nodded,*
"He's like a computer program...
Only for brains."
"The brain isn’t a computer"
~Kent interjected, but Martha cut him off.~
"I said like...
Simile, it’s similar"
~Kent didn't smile, he did raise his lips into what could be called a grin.~
~Humorless.~ 
"Okay, so you’re telling me you have a ghost in your brain, sure...
Whatever - let's run with that.
Why are you in New York?"
~Martha sighed.~
"Okay - so that’s a longer explanation..."
"Alright, let’s start with that kid outside - the not-zombie"
"He was infected with a very bad ghost in his brain."
*Rossin walked between the two of them, facing Martha.*
"This is painful. 
Either just tell him everything or stop using ridiculous metaphors."
"What else am I supposed to tell him?"
*She snapped, looking over him to Kent to say:*
"Sorry...
Okay...
So there are these things called namshubs..."
"Just let me,"
~Rossin cut over.~
"Fine."
*Martha snapped at him as she fliped the switch.*
~Martha unwound from that spinning wheel that traded their spots.~
*Rossin stretched his, her, neck.*
"Okay...
I’m Rossin, nice to meet you: So here is what’s going to happen..."
*Rossin reached out his hand.*
"First you’re going to give me that gun."
~Kent raised an eyebrow.~
"Why should I?"
~Rosisn, in Martha's body only stood still as a statue.~
"Because we don’t have much time.
Martha needs a reasonable explanation for that gunshot. 
If anyone sees you here...
You’re literally worse than dead."
*Rossin stepped forward.*
~Kent leveled the gun at him, her, with his finger still off the trigger.~
"Any time now: Felix, the one with us, is going to come through that elevator... 
With people in tow...
And you really don’t want to piss them off by...
Existing. 
Your best bet is to hide in an empty room and stay quiet until we all leave.
Which may be a while thanks to all the dead bodies in the next room over."
"Bodies...
How many"
"More than you want to know about.
Or see.
Seriously - you are in way over your head here."
*Rossin took another step forward - Kent pulled back the hammer of the gun.*
"Don’t get me killed."
~Martha watched all this from the shadow perspective studying Kent.~
~She was sure he was ready to shoot.~
*Rossin looked directly at Martha.*
"You’re dead if they find him here, you know that right?"
*Rossin turned back to Kent.*
"I’m not going to hurt you, or shoot you.
I’ll...
We’ll give it back later."
~The elevator bell rang down the hallway.~
*Kent stepped into the room.*
'Fitting, considering I also borrowed this gun.'
~Kent made a snap decision:~
*He unclasped the hammer and handed them the gun.*
"Fine, where do I meet you...
Two?"
"Central park."
~Down the hall came a shout,~
"Martha? Are you here? Are you hurt?"
"That’s huge.
Where in central park?"
*Kent hissed in a whisper.*
"South east corner,"
*Rossin replied, turning his head towards the footsteps outside the room.*
"When?"
~Kent made his way into a small utility closet.~
"Later - tonight maybe, just be around there."
*He nodded back at Martha.*
~They switched back.~
"In here!"
*Martha yelled.*
*Felix popped his head through the broken glass.*
"Oh...
YOU shot him?"
*He looked back toward the hallway.*
"What happened?"
~Martha didn’t even have to lie...~
~Just omit the truth,~
"He ran at me on all fours...
There’s a bunch of dead people in the other room."
"Which room?"
*She walked out and led him further down the hall.*
"I heard a scratching, and well..."
*She opened the door.*
~Felix’s face froze.~
*He backed away, and closed the door himself.*
"We should leave, right the fuck now."
*He made is way back toward the elevator, *
"Come on!"
~He yelled.~
"What’s going on?"
*Felix pressed the button on the elevator panel: down.*
~At his feet was the person Kent shot.~
*He turned him over, looking at his forehead.*
"This is bad..."
~He said, clearly confirming something.~
"Felix - what’s going on?"
~Martha repeated.~
*He turned to her.*
"This is death...
Not just a little death: this...
When we reconstructed your neighbor - he was still mostly whole.
One collection tightly nestled in the link...
This..."
*He pointed at the scratched out and damaged symbol on the corpse’s forehead.*
"This is like a blender - everyone’s memories of them: evaporated, like that"
*He snapped his fingers.*
"Gone forever - completely mixed in the ocean...
You can’t fix that."
*The elevator door opened.*
*They stepped inside.*
~After a moment’s pause.~
"The undernet?"
~Martha considered the word.~
*Felix turned to her, then faced forward toward the elevator doors.*
"People that think they’re Awakened - a honeypot for those that..."
*He glanced back at her,*
"Develop this awareness on their own.
They meet on the internet - we keep track of them...
They don't actually know how to do anything, or can do anything...
Or recognize things...
But they think they do."
*Rossin paced back and forth... *
"This isn't good.
He's considering if you’re with them, infiltrating"
*Rossin continued to pace and Martha fiddled around with the gun.*
*Locating and making sure the safety was on, she tucking it behind her pants.*
"So what now?"
*She asked, tucking her shirt over the gun into her pants.*
~Felix studied her, then said.~
"We’re going to Falshtine’s home, to get some answers..."
~There as an elevator ding, and they both felt the gravity suddenly shift.~
"He’s the one that made the undernet"
*The elevator doors opened to the downstairs lobby and they walked out.*
