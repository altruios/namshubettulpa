# ERRORS
{
~From the outside there was no damage to the police station.~
~Everything looked fine.~
*Martha strolled in.*
~She noticed the wet floor first, then everyone’s demeanor.~
~It didn’t take long to spot the burn marks.~
~They covered a small door down the hallway to the left.~
*Walking up to the front desk she asked,*
"What happened here?"
"Fire"
~He said gruffly.~
"Is everyone alright?"
"They took a couple people to the hospital, no word yet about them."
~He paused thinking,~
"I’m sure they’re fine - nothing to worry about."
~Which was exactly what Martha was doing.~
"Well.
Let’s find those people, they’ll still be here... 
Probably in the holding cell."
~Rossin said.~
}
{
`['There’s more to do here, obviously']`
"Well, let’s start there - let me switch."
~She obliged.~
*Once they were done trading places, Rossin turned toward the front desk again.*
`WITH(
    (hooks)
    .go(~Location of the prisoners faceing the wall~)
    .break("Thank you")
    )`
*The man behind the desk got up, and ushered them to follow.*
*They passed the burnt out room.*
~A large portion of the walls were black.~
~And currently there was yellow tape barring the entrance.~
~The entire surveillance system seems to have been burnt.~
'At least no working camera’s this time'
*Martha only nodded.*
~She followed Rossin and the officer to the back of the station.~
}
{
*Rossin entered the room with the holding cell.*
~Three people stood facing the back wall.~
*Once they had entered the room, the officer turned and left.*
"Thank you"
*The officer shook and returned to normal*
~He looked around the room.~
"That’s all it took?"
*Rossin nodded,*
"And I can switch back now?"
~Martha wasn't going to make the same mistake again~
*He nodded his head again: so she flipped the switch.*
}
{
"We should probably change your shirt - it’s still..."
~Rossin trailed off.~
~Martha looked down - seeing the blood stains make almost a designer pattern.~
"It’s already 5 now, do we have time before the red-eye?"
"We can stop somewhere on the way - it’s only a shirt we need"
"Do I need to pack anything, or?"
"No, not really."
*Her stomach growled, she looked down - annoyed - she had just eaten.*
"Yeah, get used to that."
*Rossin said, gesturing towards the door.*
*They started walking out of the station.*
"Always being hungry?"
*Rossin nodded.*
"The food in first class is excellent. 
We’ll grab some calories wherever we get the shirt"
}
{
"My home it is, everything we need."
*Rossin nodded, glancing at the watch,*
"Cutting it close, your place is not exactly on the way"
~Which was an understatement - it was completely out of the way.~
"Well, I’m done with people for right now, solitude - so off to my fortress"
*Martha said - exiting the double doors.*
~They walked into the falling sun, not at sunset - but still turning orange.~
}

{
~Kent was at Martha's house - the police tape had been cleared.~
*He pushed open the unlocked door.*
~And found it dark inside - no signs of life.~
~In the kitchen he looked at the traces of blood identified on the counter top.~
*He looked around and found nothing of particular interest.*
~No clues as to where she was, or what she had been doing.~
~On the drive over he called her work.~
~She was a teller at the local supermarket.~
~They hadn’t seen her for well over a week now - they assumed she quit.~
'How does a teller make enough to afford this place?'
~He wondered.~
~It was a nice single level home - not spacious, but clearly not cheap either.~
}
{
*He sighed - and left, cutting across the lawn to check on the neighbor.*
*He waited only a short time after knocking on the door.*
*An officer he knew with a brand on his forehead open the door.*
~Kent stared at the brand, it had a name on it, below a strange symbol.~
~When he wasn’t directly looking it slipped from his mind, unable to stick.~
"Can I help you?"
~The officer asked.~
~Kent stared blankly at him.~
"...What are you doing here?"
"I live here?"
~He looked back into the room.~
"I’m sorry, is there anything I can help you with?"
"Why aren’t you at the station?"
"Are you a cop, do you have a badge?"
*Reluctantly Kent pulled out his wallet and flashed his badge.*
"You know I am, what’s that on your head?"
*The officer dabbed at his cheek,*
"What is it?"
"Your forehead."
*The officer felt at his forehead.*
"What?"
*Rossin pushed in the door,*
"What are you doing here?"
"I told you, I live here - what are you doing here?"
"No you don’t, I know where you live."
*Behind the officer with the brand the son came up.*
"What’s going on?"
~He said.~
"This guy is saying I don’t live here?"
"Do you recognize this man?"
~Kent asked.~
"He’s my father."
"Your father died yesterday - this is officer Rogers."
"My dad isn’t a police officer, and he’s not dead."
"A body in the morgue says differently."
"A body...
With his face?"
~The son asked.~
"Well...
No - it’s a different person: this is officer Rogers, not your father."
"Sir.
Unless you have a warrant - I’m going to have to ask you to leave.
You’re scaring my boy"
"He’s not your boy, god damn it.
Rogers, what are you playing at?"
*The door slammed in Kent's face.*
}
{
~He just...~
~Stared at it, stunned.~
'What the fuck was going on?'
'And why was the son playing along.'
'As this...'
'Also Martha’s doing?'
*He knocked on the door again.*
~This time it opened only slightly - a chain drawn taught.~
"Have you seen your neighbor recently?"
~Kent asked.~
"She was in our house, she ran off, I don’t know where..."
*Rogers shut the door and Kent walked away.*
~He drove off - pondering where Martha might be...~
~Just minutes before Martha herself arrived.~
}
{

}
{
~Kent’s first question at the police station was the location of Rogers.~
~No one knew, besides himself.~
~He was supposed to be on shift.~
~Those that knew him - could care less about his current whereabouts...~
~No one seemed to remember anything odd happening that morning.~
~In fact they were normal now...~
~Talkative even, with no memory of anything odd of course.~
"Do you remember her exact words?"
~He asked.~
~Kent sat across one of those that had been facing the walls.~
~They sat in the interview room.~
"No, she was talking to herself.
Something about an eye.
A red eye."
"Was there anything else she mentioned?"
"I don’t know man, she was talking to herself - then she just left."
*Kent nodded, steepling his fingers under his chin.*
~How much sleep he had gotten.~
'Too little regardless how much.'
~He asked again.~
"And you don’t remember anything about the walls."
*The man across from him shook his head,*
"Not even a little bit"
~When Kent told him about how he was just...~
~Facing the wall.~
~Bewilderment was the response.~
~More and more he questioned his sanity...~
~And when he wasn’t...~
~He was becoming deeply troubled by who or what he might be dealing with.~
"You sure she said something about a redeye?"
"Yeah, I think her eye’s hurt or something."
*Kent stared blankly...*
"Redeye is a type of plane...
A time when...
You know what...
Never mind"
*Kent got up to leave, he knew where he had to go.*
*He looked at the clock - 6:40pm...*
~He wouldn’t be able to make it in time.~
~Not unless...~
}
{
%%%%
}
{
~7:15pm.~
*The blue lights stopped flashing, the cruiser door opened*
*Kent stepped out.*
*The beat cop waved him off and drove through the airport traffic.*
'Redeye’s leave at what, 8?'
~He had time to get through security...~
*He walked in through the sliding glass door to the ticket counter.*
~It was bent at a slight angle - showing the direction towards the ports.~
~His gaze drifted in that direction.~
}
{
~For a moment he thought he saw her.~
~Martha - at the top of the escalators - on her way through security.~
*He walked that direction - not bothering to pick up a ticket.*
~Walking up the escalators he saw Martha.~
'Yes it was her.'
~She was passing through the new giant metal detectors.~
~Kent was pretty sure those machines would give everyone cancer in a few years.~
*He pulled his hat down just a bit.*
*He turned away whenever she looked in his direction.*
~She made her way down the terminal and to the right, out of sight.~
}
{
*He laid his badge through the metal detector, along with his pistol.*
*They paused the machine and took him aside.*
~He explained he was tailing someone - and needed to get through quickly.~
~That there was no danger, none that he knew about.~
~It took precious minutes to persuade them...~
~A long talk and  a phone call to the station later: they let him through.~
~They didn't let him keep his gun, that was surrendered in that back room.~
}
{
*He jogged in the direction he saw Martha move last...*
~Nearly 10 minutes ago now.~
'Redeye...'
~He repeated in his head.~
*He Looked at the flightboards as he ran down the terminal.*
'Where was she going?'
*He stopped and looked at the board more carefully.*
~He was next to terminal 23, and it was going up...~
~He scanned the board for flights leaving that direction.~
~8 o'Clock - new york, 8 o’clock - florida 8:15, new york again.~
~All at terminals down to his left.~
}
{
*He stopped when he saw her.*
~She was talking to someone, a well dressed man with black hair.~
~They were in a coffee shop, discussing something.~
*Kent took a chair next to them - behind Martha and out of sight.*
*He leaned back a bit and listened in - pretending to be on a cellphone call.*
~Saying yes, and other affirmations repeatedly while he listened in.~
"I’ll grab the 8:00, do you need me to...?"
"I can manage."
"Have you ever flown first class?"
"Can’t say that I have. 
It was always too expensive - but that’s not really a problem now is it?"
"Get used to luxury - and get used to being paranoid. 
With ‘rich’ people, there’s always a chance there’s one of us among them. 
So if you ever need to hide, fly coach."
"Where should I meet you, when we land?"
"Baggage claim - we’ll ride together, they’re boarding now...
You sure you can do this...
Your neighbor."
"Was a fluke - I got...
Distracted"
~There was a pause.~
"Well.
Don’t get distracted again."
*There was a skuffeling of chairs, and Kent turned around to see they had left.*
}
{
~Both were going to the same place.~
~And he was faced with a choice...~
'Continue following Martha? 
Or tail this new person for a while? 
Someone who’s never seen his face.'
~To his right was a flight board...~
*He studied it.*
~There was no other place they could have meant.~
~New York.~
~He would be going to the same place regardless...~
~And tailing Martha - maybe she would see him on a cramped plane...~
*He fished in his pocket - pulled out a coin...*
'Heads - Martha, tails - this new fellow.'
*He flipped the coin in the air and caught it.*
*Then he slammed it into the back of his other palm.*
~Tails.~
}
{
*He looked at his watch, 7:55pm.*
~He made his way to the boarding booth for the 8:00 flight.~
*He flashed his badge,*
"I need a seat in first class. 
Following someone who may or may not be a dangerous man, no need to panic...
But I need that seat."
*They typed for a bit on their computer,*
"All the first class seats are taken... 
But if you wait, there might be a no-show...
Or there’s a seat in the coach that’s just behind first class."
~Their voice quavered just a little bit.~
"I’ll wait, if there’s room in first, I would rather keep eyes on him...
If not, coach will be fine."
*They nodded, and he took a seat at the terminal.*
}
{
~The boarding call came on over the speakers...~
~Crackley though mostly intelligible...~
~Kent sat and watched the man.~
*The man held a phone to the boarding booth’s attendant's face.*
~The attendent's eye twitched a little bit and they let the man pass.~
*The next in line snapped fingers in the attendent's face.*
~The blank stare left the attendent.~
}
{
*After everyone had boarded he went back up to the attendant.*
"There is room in first, and one in coach"
~They said.~
"B4, and E2"
~He chose B4, the seat in first class, and boarded the plane.~
~He hoped he didn’t make a grave mistake.~
