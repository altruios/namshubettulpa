# LIONS TIGERS AND BEARS
{
~martha sat in the back of the police car, Albert driving - and the scrawny police officer up front.~
~Felix sat next to her in the back and Rossin...~
~He just sort of floated in the middle of the divider - sitting on the armrest in front facing backwards~
~His front half was poking through the thick plastic.~
}
{
"I am curious, though.
How did you learn about...
all of this?"
~felix asked,~
"it’s just that most people usually have a sponsor, a teacher, that gets them in"
"I...
 well."
~Rossin talked over the sound of the engine and Martha repeated:~
"How does anyone learn about this observation, that there’s a secret cabal...
a bit of luck I guess.
There were some posts on the internet, and that took me down a rabbit hole.
That there was a meritocracy, and..."
*felix waved his hand, his question answered.*
"Okay.
second lesson: ready?"
~again he didn’t pause, ~
"don’t say anything more than you need to"
~and he fell silent, Martha started to ask.~
*but he raised a hand, then asked*
"why?"
*Rossin started tapping his fist to a beat and counting his finger after a set, She looked at Rossin,*
"he means information is power, the more freely it’s shared the more diluted it is, the less useful it is to you..."
~she rolled her head just enough to give the impression , 'okay, but what does he want to hear?'~
~Rossin finished counting with his finger.~
"One word answer, something to show you understand...
 like-"
"Power."
*Felix nodded,*
"power over you, power you lose."
"Then why teach at all?"
*Martha asked as Rossin groaned.*
~Felix paused, considering.~
*he looked at his hands.*
"Nothing lives forever, everything dies, many deaths before the final one"
~Martha thought he doesn’t really obey this second rule often, he’s quite talkative...~
}
{
"We’re here,"
~Martha said, having seen the yellow police tape in front of her house and her neighbor’s.~
*Felix barked an order and Albert pulled into their driving lot - breaking the tape in the process.*
"Go clean that up,"
~Felix told the officer in the front seat,~
"let us out,"
~Who promptly did as told.~
*Felix walked over to the neighbors building and rang the door.*
"Did he have any flat-mates?"
~he asked.~
~Martha paused,~
"I think one.
Son I believe."
"Even better,"
*Felix exclaimed as the door opened, he pulled out his phone and shoved it in the man’s face.*
}
{
"What are -"
~his words cut off as he grew limp. ~
*and walked to the center of the room.*
~He wore a glassy eyed stare that didn’t see anything.~
*Felix put the phone back in his pocket.*
~Rossin commented,~
"useful trick..."
"You, in here!"
~he commanded the smaller officer inside, while Albert stood placidly with the yellow police tape.~
"you, guard."
~Albert stood outside as Felix held the door.~
*Martha moved in and Felix followed.*
"Don’t let him show you anything on this phone...
 or your phone for that matter"
~Rossin continued.~
"It’s a general hook setter...
I didn’t get a good look at it...
because you didn’t...
which is good - it looks like it’s just a general command to follow his voice prompts."
*Martha walked to where the outline of a body in white caulk was sketched into the wooden floor.*
"Clean that up, both of you,"
~and they did as they were told.~
*Felix stolled to the couch - and sat down - beckoning Martha to join him.*
}
{
*she sat across from him on the u-shaped couch.*
"He’s in the back of the mind somewhere. 
Snd his relative will help bring him out.  
Flat-mate, or neighbor would have been fine - just someone who knows him. 
Have you ever been to the back of the mind?"
*Martha shook her head,*
"You know what it is?"
*Martha raised her hand, shook it in a noncommittal gesture.*
"More or less, less than more"
"Alright then, well, it’s a place...
not connected by location, but by...
ideas, emotions...
and if you’ve never been there...
it’s not 3-dimensional...
it’s a lot higher...
more like infinitely dimensional.
Each place is connected to every other place along some emotional path - and a place here, again...
isn’t a physical location, but a concept, or an idea."
~he paused.~
"When I say your neighbor is in the back of the mind...
it’s not like he’s at any one of these ideas. 
he’s larger than a single idea - he’s taking up several, in a local cluster...
the longer he’s dead -the more he’s been forgotten - the more spread out those ideas - that network - becomes.
To eventually the point where he doesn’t exist as an identity anymore. 
where the largest part of him is one of these small ideas...
he mixes in the ocean, when he was a drop before...
it’s a long process - when no one knows who you were, you cease to be.
that is the final death: the death in the back of everyone else’s mind"
*Martha nodded.*
~Rossin interjected,~
"he’s mostly right...
but he’s leaving some things out. 
but it’s a fair jist of what it is. 
he’s pretty good at explaining, I think."
}
{
~Martha Started.~
"So how does he..."
"Come back?"
"No, not recognize that he’s not himself...
he’ll be in someone else, won’t he?...
and that too, how does he come back?"
"He’ll have a brand on his head - his identity, ignored by those that don’t know him.
And anyone who sees it will think it’s him.
Even if they don’t recognize him at first. 
Once they get a look at his face - they’ll be like, ‘oh my god, I didn’t recognize you’,"
~he emphasized the last with an oververtly high falsetto~
"and their memories will be written over to match the face they expect. 
the face they saw before will have been the face they presume to see now."
~Martha thought for a bit, Felix waited,~
"so what if he...
hits his head, damages the...
wait did you say brand?"
*Felix shrugged,*
"nothings perfect.
But it’s unlikely...
it’s not like anyone stops recognizing him when he turns away for a second.
It imprints on whoever sees it: they see the person they expect to see when they see this person...
this new face is the face that has always been in their minds...
it rewrites memories to match.
Even if the mark is destroyed - everyone still recognizes the new face as the old...
it’s a namshub for everyone else, not the wearer."
}
{
*Felix pulled out of a pocket, a small metal circle - with a small based trapezoid...*
~it looked a bit like the omega symbol.~
~The small base had a series of dials, each rotatable and with a notch for each letter.~
*Rossin leaned over to inspect the device as Felix spoke.*
"The center part is the general command, the letters are just writing out the name - easy for others to see...
 this isn’t exactly my first rodeo - I’ve made some mistakes too. 
 Doing this without this is a bit of a pain, but possible"
*Rossin whistled as Felix returned the device to his pocket.*
"Just needs a bit of fire,"
"Not electric?"
~Martha asked.~
"...an electric brand - it’s not a taser,"
"A heated piece of wire, for the center...
 I’m not sure how exactly you’d do the rotating letters."
~Felix paused...~
"that’s...
not a half-bad idea."
*he smiled and looked over behind him.*
}
{
~The two under his command were stationary, finished with their work.~
"Go light a fire, and you."
*he pointed to the scrawny sacrifice,*
"go get changed - upstairs, not his clothing, the other one’s."
*without even any acknowledgement the officer moved up the stairs.*
*the other went into the kitchen to turn on the stove.*
"Anyway, about getting him back... 
it’s just identifying what collection of ideas, what network to put back inside. 
that’s what the son is for, he knows the boundary, the surface. 
which is exactly perfect - it’ll contain all that’s within...
there’ll be some leakage...
some parts won’t make it back...
but it’ll be a small amount...
not enough to make a meaningful difference.
But every death...
there is some loss. 
that’s entropy: unavoidable"
*Felix tossed the device to the son, *
}
{
"twist the dial so it says your father’s name on the branding side, put that side in the fire..."
*he looked back at the kitchen.*
"And wear some kitchen gloves"
*he turned back to martha.*
"Don’t make that mistake...
be explicit"
}
{
*Rossin paced from the door to the kitchen entrance, listening and thinking.*
"Okay - so you need to make sure he gets you to the New York academy, his ticket...
They want him as a teacher there - he can get you in..."
*Martha turned to Rossin, Felix looked back.*
"What is it?"
~Felix asked.~
*Martha looked back  ,*
"sorry, I thought I heard something.
What happens after this, you said you were a teacher, is there a school"
*Felix's mouth twitched its corner into something resembling a smile*
"I don’t, well....
They have been asking me to teach...
hounded me actually.
I just never had a reason to. 
I would have rather spent my days practically alone...
practicing alone, on a cruise around fiji. 
Enjoying gourmet food, and silence"
*He tilted his head.*
"There wasn’t any reason either, I was a good student, but...
they didn’t take to me, the teachers that is, to me too much...
I think it was their way of trying to keep an eye on me, that is, getting me to teach."
}
{
~Martha paused.~
~Rossin urgered her on.~
"Or they knew you would be good at it"
*Felix smiled.*
~Not a happy one.~
"Or they knew I would be good at it..
Two things can be true, maybe it was both"
~Martha waited, Felix studying her.~
"I’ll train you for a time, and if you’re good enough - you can meet other’s like you...
but I...
well...
you know that phase.
Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely...
imagine a few scores of people - eager to learn - to succeed - with this kind of power...
it turns you machevellion - quickly.
Quicker than you know."
~Martha wasn’t sure if that last bit was directed at her, or himself, or a memory of his.~
}
{
*But he snapped his head up at the sound of footsteps falling down the stairs*
"We’re mostly done here,"
*he turned his head back to the stairs*
~the officer had his uniform bundled in his arm.~
"I’ll take that,"
*he reached out and grabbed the uniform...*
*looking back at martha*
"rule three: less of a rule more of a suggestion: costumes are fun. 
you can write in a costume in their mind, but why do the extra work"
*he turned his head back to the kitchen,*
"son, go brand your new father on the forehead."
*Felix tilted his head to the once-been officer.*
"And think deeply about your father."
*the son moved into the living room, brandishing the red hot iron device, and did as instructed.*
}
{
*Felix grabbed the back of both their heads and closed his eyes.*
~A moment later, ~"
there,"
*and Felix leaned back.*
}
{
"What exactly did you do?"
~Martha asked.~
"That was it, just...
putting the shape of him back into a physical form...
the son had a strong sense of him - easy to collect...
if you haven’t been inside the back of the mind, it’s...
hard to explain...
also - things move faster in there."
*Felix leaned back.*
~the father’s expression was still blank.~
"Give it a moment, it’ll be like he’s waking up..."
}
{
*felix yawned, and stretched.*
"I’ve been on a flight since last night - and I’ve been awake for much too long, I’ll see you in...
the evening I guess"
*he glanced outside.*
~The sun just now angrily shined through the windows.~
*Martha yawned - involuntary,*
"I’ve had a night myself."
*felix laughed,*
"there’s my place, I have a couch"
~Martha suggested~
~Rossin looked disappointed.~
*He was shaking his head, Felix shook his as well.*
}
{
"Rule zero: you ready?"
~This time he did wait until she nodded.~
"Don’t trust anyone...
especially while you sleep"
*and with that he stood up.*
"That’s the most important one of all.
Don’t trust anyone - no one has exactly your goals. 
Don’t give them such an easy avenue into you as when you sleep."
*he walked out the door.*
~Martha waited on the couch and heard the police car pull away.~
}
{
*Rossin paced back and forth.*
"I think we got him...
I haven’t worked out what he wants exactly yet..."
*Martha jumped when the neighbor came to life, his son also started awake.*
*They both turned to her.*
"What the fuck are you doing in my house?"
~the father asked.~
~Martha looked at his forehead and knew the face before her wasn’t her neighbors.~
~but she couldn’t tell what the difference was.~
~She had a sharp moment of vertigo as she remembered the body on the floor, a different body, and shook her head.~
~the moment passed.~
}
{
*The father started toward her, prompting Martha to sprint for the door.*
*She just make distance before the son could reach her.*
*she ran down the street,*
"keep going"
~rossin said.~
~She passed her house: focused on running down the sidewalk.~
}
{
~The son stood on the porch with his father...~
"Seriously, how did she get in, we were standing right there?"
*The father grunted, and angrily waved her off.*
"Go make sure she didn’t steal anything.
I didn’t see anything on her..."
*he grunted again, and walked back inside, closing the door.*
