    A surviving ${}-tok in the lab of Alice - directing the manufacture of her serum among themselves, laments their inability to find a needle in a haystack.
    Goals: scene is to hammer home what al-tok is, his limitations, and a better picture of his immediate goals.
    
    
    Flanagan abandons his body, which dies when they enter the real world.
    He takes over Felix, who is kept in the back-seat of his mind.

    Flanagan rifles though his brain //links to chapters and events with Kent\\: walking the chemist on the hospital bed.
    pragmatic reasons to keep the charade going - (he finds them).
    ~Everyone was in their own world, and trying to force everyone else to join them.
    But by pulling equally in all directions: commonalities appeared, ripples and echos of coherence.
    harmonizing waves in a sea of minds bound the desires of the outliers, often in persecution.
    ~



    Rossin and Martha have a conversation:
        - Martha thinks Rossin knew that much algera would kill her,
        - Hedges her bets against Alacira if she is mistaken or lying: she keeps her suspicions close to herself,
        - Rossin is excited at the prospect of exiting the link physically, if he could get into it,
    Wilbert complains that he only can go out on Halloween now, Wilbert is not awake... just a fish-man,

    - Martha gives her a book - which Alacira destroys: disappearing.
    - Felix overheads (as a Relux) tries to keep it a secret: fails ; breaks from the Relux
flanagan is sure al-tok is dealt with.

Felix overhears - as a relux - they all do and see Alacira disappear - felix breaks from the relux.

When Martha arrives, felix is gone, Flanagan is bleeding out on the floor - when he dies - he uses the landing pad on martha.
Flanagan explains about the reality walkers - and to his surprise - is found to be without admin rights in her head, a consequence of Rossin being in there first.

She burns a stack of papers that may or may not be a catchall cure for cancer written in exactly one place.

She herself disappears - with a little help from Flanagan.

big notes:: 
  
  plot line threads to keep track of: 
    the way out needs to be added.
  
  A lot of this is old - and needs to be revamped.
