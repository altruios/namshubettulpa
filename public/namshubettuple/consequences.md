~Martha stood inside the bubble watching herself unfold outside in a fractal pattern of her life~
~In front of them was a cube that reflected no light~
"M::In there"
'M::Why would Rossin want you dead?'
~The more she thought about it, the more she didn't think that was the case~
~He was in her, after all, her death would have meant his~
~Thoughts of the scorpion and the frog crossing a river danced fleetly in her mind~
*The reached the cube*
~They were cast into darkness~
~The interior lights flipped on~
~They were along metal rings at the perimeter of the bubble~
~As long as they went straight, Martha was sure, they would reach that hallway~
'M::In any case, we have Flanagan here - '
*She turned to Flanagan*
*Sonny was pumping his chest*
~Flanagan wasn't moving~
'M::Well fuck.'
*Sonny looked up at the captain*
"A::Don't worry, he probably got out"
*Flanagan's body melted into the hardwood floor of the bubble*
~It crumpled to dust, and glittered into non-existence~
"G::See, that's a good sign, actually"
"A::Gerald"
~Alacira had her hand out~
*Gerald lowered a lever*
~The bubble slowed~
"M::There"
~Martha saw it - as a long concept - a hallway in the darkness~
~Around it could have been anything~
~So Gerald piloted the bubble to be right next to it~
~He put it into park~
"A::We should all exit the bubble before exiting that hallway"
~Martha led the way, extending her hand to find the handle~
~She waited until all were outside the bubble, then she opened the door~
~A brass bridge met them, followed by wooden doors, and a hallway made of lead~
"M::It's a long way up."
~She was not looking forward to the climb~
~As they started up the stairs they heard chittering behind them~
"G::Gangway"
~Sonny was in a hammock of silk~
~Which both spiders were carrying by its ends~
~From the ceiling they which were racing up~
*Sonny made a few more chitters as she passed by Martha*
'R::She is asking if you want a ride as well'
~Rossin was besides her~
"G::They'll be back for us - one at a time"
~Martha took the last one~
~Using her hesitancy to ride the spider elevator to cover for her hesitancy in speaking to rossin~
~She wrote on the console to her left~
`"Flanagan is dead."`
'R::Well and truly, or is he going to come back'
~Gerald was second to last to go up~
"M::Was wilbert born here?"
"G::What? 
No. 
He is from a dream"
"M::And he's in the real world now"
"G::Martha, life is but a dream, and don't think about it too hard, some thoughts are dangerous"
"M::Dangerous"
*Gerald sat down in the web*
"G::I'll tell you up there"
'R::Martha, is something wrong?'
"M::No, well."
*Rossin paced in front of her*
"M::That much Algera would have killed me"
'R::Who said that?'
*Martha nodded upstairs*
"M::Captain Alacira up there"
'R::You have a rather large hole in you.
Made bigger by that thing in your head... 
And me isolating of that thing in your head.
You were, are, an empty bucket.
Most of your person has been been eaten by that thing already.
A sponge, you would have been fine.'
*The spiders came for her*
~They were, a short time later they were in Flanagan's study~ 
~Alacira was ruffling though Flanagan's desk~
~Gerald was just across the room, pouring brandy~
*Gerald sat down*
~The leather in the chair creaked~
"G::Thoughts themselves can be dangerous.
They have a shape, you see.
Some shapes can have an edge, the more you look at it - the sharper it gets.
A fact leads to a counter-fact, leads to a counter fact.
An infinite fractal, that burns into your identity.
It grows sharper the more you think about it, and it cuts deep between things."
"W::Does he have a date on that desk"
"A::February 18"
*Wilbert snapped his fingers*
~It sounded wet~
~He had stuffed his hands into his pockets before Martha had a chance to see~  
'M::Not halloween'
~Martha suppressed a smile, and realized, that was probably the only time he could easily go out in pubic~
~Without being killed or becoming famous, that is~
