#### A packet of information exchanged through  [the-link](the-link.md), via an external physical trigger (hook).
#### It is not seen or heard, bypassing both senses to go directly to the brain.
#### It can overwrite memory or experience by causing any arbitrary chemical change in the brain.
#### Abuse or misuse of the language is an easy death sentence.
