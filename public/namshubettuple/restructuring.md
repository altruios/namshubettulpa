# RESTRUCTURING

"M::If Flanagan made the undernet then isn't he in charge of them? "
~The cab driver was excellent at weaving through traffic.~
~His face frozen, his eyes though...~
*His eyes repeatedly scanned back and forth.*
~The driver side window was rolled down, wind roaring in.~
'Maybe the wind drowned me out'
"M::If Flanagan made the -"
~Felix cut her off.~
"F::It's possible."
~He leaned in the back seat.~
~Rossin was taking up the other back seat.~
*Rossin shook his head.*
"F::I don't think it's likely...
When you meet Flanagan, you'll understand."
"M::So he's ignorant of what they're doing?"
*Felix immediately shook his head*
"F::No: he knows, at least he'd better.
We just don't know what his plan is right now...
because we...
I, am a bit out of the loop."
*Rossin displayed his palms*
~His position was one of 'what'da gonna do?'~
"R::I literally choose him at random...
Random from a pool of people with the right Admin privileges."
`"So you didn't vet him?"`
*Rossin mimed looking around*
"R::When would I find the time?
I've been talking to you all day."
`"You're a program, cant you do things at like...
the speed of thought or whatever?"`
"R::You do things at the speed of thought."
~Martha paused.~
'Fuck'
`"Good point"`
*Felix repeatedly tapped his finger on his leg.*
"R::So I know Flanagan didn't...
He didn't kill my author...
But someone he knows probably did."
`"Why do you say that?"`
"R::The thing that attacked my author, it left...
Sharp edges in me...
There are large chunks of me just...
Missing.
I can see how much is missing, and...
I'm..."
~Rossin stopped at that point and sat there with his head down~
*Martha fell to her right, Felix did as well, Rossin sat balanced.*
"F::We are...
Just about..."
*The cabbie pulled into an alley, then a garage entrance*
"F::Here."
}
{
~Fluorescent lights and floors of concrete lower they reached the bottom.~
"F::You don't have any weapons on you, right - leave them in the car otherwise."
~Martha was about to protest, but felt the weight of the gun at her side.~
~She slid it out and dropped it under the seat, giving it a little kick also.~
*Felix nodded, and opened the door.*
*He held out her hand toward her, as she slid herself across the seat.*
~The car was parked blocking some cars in on Martha's side.~
~To her right was the entrance to a little cave alcove containing elevators.~
"F::Don't look away from the security guard, blinking is fine...
But keep your eyes on him."
*Martha tilted her head but nodded.*
*They approached the elevators.*
"R::He's really serious about that, by the way... 
Don't look away, not even internally to write on the board."
`'Why?'`
~Martha noticed the color of that screen change~
`'Why is that a different color now?'`
"M::That?"
`'This screen.'`
"R::That's you thinking at me versus you talking at me...
Oh, and other why is because then we die."
~Inside was a single security guard, sitting in a folding chair.~
"R::His eyes, Martha - keep looking at his eyes."
*Rossin said, pointing at the security guard.*
~She did, although he was not looking at her.~
~He had his feet up on another folding chair, with a newspaper in his hands.~
"F::Hello, we're here to see Flanagan."
*The security guard folded his newspaper, and took a small sip of coffee.*
*He placed the cup down on a third fold up chair and sighed.*
"SG::Name."
"F::Felix"
~A small pause.~
*Felix tapped his foot against hers.*
"M::Martha."
~Another small pause.~
~Martha noticed small twitches in the guards eyes, his eyes dilating wildly.~
"SG::Go."
*He picked up his coffee again and took another sip.*
*Felix stepped backwards toward the elevator behind him and pressed the button.*
*The security guard put down his cup and tossed Felix the key from his pocket.*
*Felix nodded, as he caught it.*
~The elevator door gave a ding and the light above lit.~
"F::Martha!"
~She had started to turn her head~
"R::Backwards Martha - keep you're eyes on the guard - long as you can see him."
*Martha straightened her neck and stepped backwards towards Felix.*
*The doors swung open, Felix and Martha stepped inside.*
~Moments later, when the door was closed, and they're eyes could move again:~
"M::What happened to us being gods?"
"F::Some gods are stronger than others."
*He pressed the key into a slot and turned.*
~The elevator made a clanking noise, and fell downward, lurching Martha's lunch.~
*She held on to the side railing across from Felix who was doing the same.*
~The elevator slowed over time, and eventually came to a gentle rest.~
~And above them through the speakers emitted an annoyingly chirpy ding.~
*The doors opened, and Felix and Martha walked out.*

{
~Kent sat alone on a park bench.~
*He glanced at his watch between chews of his bagel.*
'Two-thirty, let me see...
4pm would hit the 12 hour mark of day 2.'
~He briefly considered taking a small nap on the bench...~
~But decided he would stay at a hotel.~
*He stood up, and walked along the city edge*
~He could afford a few hours yet...~
'Somewhere close by.'
~He scanned the streets beyond the park.~
~In the short distance he saw a hotel sign - dolphin.~
'A bit ritzy but that is close.'
~Down beyond the sign in front of the main entrance something caught Kent's eye~
~A shorter woman was holding out a phone in front of her like a shield...~
'No - more like a weapon.'
~She held out her phone facing an older gentleman of 60's in a dapper suit.~
~He stared slack-jawed at it - unmoving.~
*Kent moved closer to the entrance, recognizing this phone business from Felix.*
~Suddenly the older man sprang to life.~
*She switched phones with him, and Kent saw him enter his password for her.*
*A moment later she took her phone back and walked off.* 
~Leaving the man stupefied.~
*Kent navigated the river of cars - which was gridlocked, and reached the old man.*
~The man shook his head - like he was trying to get water out of his ear.~
"K::Can you tell me anything about that woman?"
*Kent approached and flashed his badge*
~It was a quick flash - he wasn't NYPD.~
~The man tilted his head slightly~
"SM::What woman?"
*Kent sighed and brushed past him - rounding the corner where she had turned.*
~He was in an alley - the woman, she wore a red cardigan, was at a metal door at the end.~
'Was she always wearing a red cardigan?'
~Kent used the edged of his foot, walking quietly as possible~
*He approached behind her, she was entering a code on a keypad*
*The door hissed open.* 
*She opened then walked through the door.*
~Kent was close enough to the door to make a dash for it~
*He did.*
~His finger fit in to stop the door slamming shut.~
'Bad idea Kent'
*Kent opened the door slightly and peered inside*
~A dimly lit hallway - and no person or camera in sight.~
*He opened the door a bit more.*
~There was nothing around the edged of the room, just a hallway.~
*He slid through the opening and closed the door gently.*
'This is a really bad idea Kent.'
'You know those horror movies where the person goes in alone into the den of a lion?'
'That is you right now: this is what is going on.'
'You have not had sleep in: how long?'
'Come on Kent - get out of here.'
~Kent pushed forward.~
'What if another zombie thing shows up: no gun Kent.'
~He was momentarily back in that hallway - shooting at that bloody thing rushing him.~
~He shook the thought away.~
*Kent walked down the hall - and looked around the corner at the end.*
~He could hear sounds - jovial.~
~He could see a small gathering of beanbag chairs in a circle.~
~Some were empty - but most were filled with people.~
~Surrounding them were chalkboards, covered in writing~
~He was too far away to make out the writing.~
~He felt a hand on his shoulder.~
"AG::First time?"
~Kent turned his head to see another Woman right behind him.~
*He nodded.*
'Okay - go with the flow - act like you belong...'
'Stay calm: do not freak out.'
"AG::Come."
*She placed her hand on Kent's back.*
"AG::How'd you find us?"
'Fuck - 2 seconds in and already panicking.'
'37 hours awake?'
'Is that right?'
'She is looking at you - answer: anything!'
"K::Oh, you know: saw some stuff... 
Read some stuff...
Put two and two together..."
'That sounded convincing, right?'
*He was led by her to sit down in on of the bean bags.*
~Around him was a stochastic wave of interest...~
~Expressed as a void, a gap in conversation...~ 
~A subtle look, often followed by an 'anyway'~
"AG::We start in a few moments, I'll let you get settled."
*She herself walked to the other side of the room.*
*And then distributed paper among those sitting.*
~One paper reached Kent's hands as he passed the rest over.~
"RG::Hi, I'm Robert."
~A voice came from his left.~
"K::Kent."
~Kent distractedly replied - reading though the paper.~
~Then the writing on the boards.~
`{dime:: link of paper propaganda of the undernet}`
*Kent looked around*
~Half way though he had to force him self to keep scanning.~
'That man...'
~Tucked away in the corner of the room, was a shaven bald man~
~Perching on a cabinet - like an owl.~
*Kent rescanned the room.*
~Ahead of him a that woman came out with a platter of syringes~
'ah fuck.
in too deep kent, 2 minutes in and in too deep...
this shit escelates way too quickly'

{
~A long hallway entrance in victorian wood lit by candle light~
~At the end: a mahogany door.~
*Felix walked up to the door, Martha at his side.*
*Felix paused.*
"You ready?"
~Before she could respond a creaking came from in front of them.~
*The door swung open by a man in a robe.*
~A bath robe.~
"Enter and palaver for a time."
"Hello Flanagan, how are things?"
*Flanagan shifted his robe, and leaned against the door, inviting them in.*
"Better now that you're here."
~Off to the left of the door was a set of inlaid plaques.~
*Rossin walked off and stared at one.*
"Come in, inside: you're the first to arrive."
~Martha turned her head to the plaques.~
"Over here, come look at this."
*Rossin said pointing at the plaque.*
~Martha hesitated briefly.~
*Felix entered through the door.*
*Martha turned her head to Rossin, then walked forward.*
"Trust me, over here - now."
*Martha sighed and walked over to where Rossin was pointing.*
"It's blank."
`"So?"`
"It should have my name on it."
"We'll be right in, have a seat in the parlor."
*Flanagan closed the door, then walked up to Martha.*
"Okay, so - this either works or it doesn't, see that keypad"
~She did, it was below the plaque, slightly off to the left~
"Put in these numbers:"
~A list followed - she typed them in.~
~As she entered the last one a pleasant chirp came from the tiny speaker attached to the left~
~Flanagan nodded.~
"Glad to see that worked...
Who are you?"
"Martha"
"He's asking me."
"Oh... Rossin, his name's Rossin."
"He's inside of... interesting... and you?
Martha - how are you?"
*Rossin walked forward toward Flanagan.*
"Rossin... and he's been helpful?"
~Martha paused considering.~
*Rossin at her side started pacing back and forth.*
"I mean...
yes.
yes...
he has been helpful..."
'Hold on a sec...'
"If by helpful you mean flinging me into a bunch of bullshit trouble...
Then yeah: super helpful."
*Flanagan blinked, then barked a high pitch laugh*
'More of a squeal than a laugh'
"There is some bullshit going on yes...
But we're in the middle of cleaning that up."
*Flanagan inspected the air around her, then waved her forward.*
"Come on in, I can at least patch over some of the leaking...
If he wants."

*He stepped back into the room - leaving the door open.*
*He popped his head back out, causing martha to stumble.*
"One last question: felix?"
~Rossin leaned over to look inside.~
"He want's to know if we can trust him."
"No."
*Martha shook her head.*
"Martha - just repeated what I say: "
~And she did.~
"He's been relaxing in Fiji: for the last year.
I - Rossin, think that he's typical."
"Typical..."
~Flanagan muttered~
"Fixable?"
*Rossin gave a noncommittal hand balance*
"He went like:"
*Martha copied Rossin's gesture*
"And you?"
"If he's fixable - good core in a bad wrapping or rotten through?"
*Martha repeated the gesture.*
*Flanagan nodded, then left the threshold.*
~Martha let out a sigh~
`"What just happened?"`
"verification code: ..."
`"And"`
"And I could prove he knew me... 
Which is good..."
*Martha looked at him.*
"But your name was gone..."
"More like we all perceive that it's gone - because that reference to me is just... gone."
"But I never saw it - how could I know it was a reference to you?"
"It's weirder when you get to the details...
And we really don't have time right now - here."
`{TODO: link to logic of that.}`
*Rossin walked to the doorway*
"Have a read through that when you have some time."
*Martha pushed open the door*
~Before the hallway was cast in a golden light emanating from the room.~
~It was bright enough to be blinding, that didn't make sense to her.~
~As she stepped in it was like a switch had been flipped and she could see.~
"...Oh what the fuck."
~The room was atrociously decorated in the most garish wallpaper imaginable.~
~Purple against green askew and uneven lines covered the wall.~
~Nothing was a right angle.~
~Everywhere the eye look every burned into her brain.~
"It's a landing pad."
*Rossin said as he walked down the little alcove stairs in the left.*
"Watch your step on these..."
`"Landing pad?"`
*Rossin poked his head back inside this small section of the room*
"It's a place - a place you burn in a bunch of people's brain...
And you...
Land there - if you need to...
If you die."
~Flanagan was at the threshold to another entrance, Felix at a chair beyond.~
"Come on now, we don't have all day"
*Rossin walked over and then next to her as she sat down next to felix.*
"That's a culture thing: a landing pad is a dominance thing...
Sort of a 'if I die I can come for your body from your dreams', kind of thing."
~Martha paused briefly, she nearly sat down before she hesitated.~
`"That's a little fucked."`
*Rossin nodded his head.*
*Martha sat down next to Felix.*
~Flanagan was about to speak when a chime rang.~
"Oh, that would be two of the Relux"
"Where's the third"
~Felix inquired.~
"Still in Romania: now If you'll excuse me."
~After Flanagan left the room for the center door, Martha asked:~
"Relux?"
"Name of a hivemind - three people sharing three bodies."
~Martha paused.~
"Can anyone do that?"
*Felix raised his hand and shook it noncommittally.*
"Theoretically, yeah - but it's sort of: well."
~Felix paused.~
"You don't get large groups or many groups because well: just imagine..."
*Martha waved him on.*
"Imagine if you can hear someone's thoughts - no filter.
Every bad nasty thing thought in passing that doesn't get said:
Most people are at each others throats with that level of connectivity"
"So it's a constant connection - you can't turn it on or off?"
"This I'm not that familiar with - thought never appealed to me: so I didn't learn more."
~Martha sat in silence for a time - pondering what that would be like.~
"I mean - I'm just in your head - our thoughts aren't connected"
*Rossin sat down beside her*
"So imagine this: but more extreme. just"
*Rossin puts up a mock hand and jabbers with it*
"Gibberish all day - most people - even the Awakened: their thoughts are a mess."
~Through the threshold step Flanagan and Two people next to him.~
~A burley man - dark skin and curly black hair, and a thin tall blonde beside him.~
*They stepped forward and sat on the couch across from them*
*Felix rose to take their hands, and with only a subtle prompting from Rossin, Martha did likewise*
"Relux, What's the news?"
*Felix said sitting back down*
*The man turned to Flanagan*
"How much does he know?"
"I haven't had time to question them, you arrived shortly after."
"Question us about what the school? that's why we're here - we just came from there."
"It was more than just the school in new york"
"What, the one in london?"
"It was more than just the schools, though they were all hit."
~Felix fell silent~
"What all was attacked?"
~Martha asked.~
"The schools, a number of hubs, assassinations... you were one of the first we think."
"Me?"
"I think he means me, my author I mean."
"I mean Rossin."
"Who's Rossin?"
~Felix asked~
"The first assassination victim - what's left of him is in Martha over here."
*Felix turned to Martha.*
"So all this time?"
"Speaking of, he's leaking pretty badly - Jochek - would you?"
*The blonde woman nodded and held out her hand*
"I don't bite"
"It's alright - I need some fixing: she can do it."
~Rossin said.~
*Martha reached out her hand and clasped Jochek's*
~For a moment time seized, stuttering a jerking to a halt~
~Rossin faded from view and time jerked back~
~Her left eye was close - she couldn't open it~
~Martha tried and failed to raise her left arm.~
~She couldn't feel it... or anything on her left side.~
"How long should this take?"
~It came out slurred - her voice breaking as only half of it worked~
~A wave a nausea passed her.~
"Not that much longer."
*Flanagan turned back from the other Relux, looking back at martha.*
"Do we need a bag?"
*Felix asked looking around*
*Martha waved him no*
'Hold a thought, hold your stomach, hold your breath'
~The dusty memory of her mother's drinking song, was the very thought she held~
~The nausea passed eventually~
~Replaced by a coldness~
"Okay, that should just about do it"
~Moments passed and Rossin didn't appear~
"Now that's taken care of, to the matter at hand. we think we lost about two thirds"
"two thirds of?"
~Jochek asked~
"of the Awakened"
~Flanagan said flatly~
~At the table in front of them was a tea set.~
*Flanagan sat down and poured himself a cup.*
"I say we think, because it's hard to say exactly"
"You can't remember them"
~Martha found herself speaking before she realized~
*Flanagan nodded*
"I can't even remember Rossin"
"Oh that's not good"
~Rossin was sitting beside her now~
`"You alright?"`
"Never better... 
Well, that I remember, literally the best I've been."
"We know the loses by the absence of where they should be, physically and in memory"
*Flanagan took a sip of tea*
"And in my case I had something more concrete to measure by, sample by... it's about two thirds"
*Rossin leaned over*
"Landing pad - more than likely"
`"How"`
`{todo:link to description of how that works}`
~Both the Relux's hands reached for the teapot - before only Jochek pouring themselves cups put it back~
"We haven't noticed anything in Romania"
*Flanagan nodded*
"Still though, look for signs of missing things"
"We saw them, at the tower."
~Felix said quietly~
"Burned into their foreheads was a message - underestimated undernet"
*Flanagan put down the teacup*
"I believe there to be an outside influence - a strong one - manipulating the undernet.
The leaders of the undernet being led along towards us."
"Two thirds..."
~Felix Exclaimed~
"Two thirds scrambled, at once... so we know it was the undernet?"
*The male Relux leaned forward and spoke*
"More complicated: they're involved, but they don't have the numbers to pull something like this off, and how?"
*He shook his head*
"No, and who did they scramble - and why: you know what I think - coup"
"Nail on the head and winds from my sails, lenny. 
I think it's a coup too, and the undernet is being pushed in the spotlight"
*Jochek leaned in*
"Underestimated undernet was in all the schools"
*Lenny matched Jochek posture*
"Heavy handed."
"It would imply,"
*Flanagan sipped his tea*
"That it's still a minority of what's left"
"So what, the undernet's the scapegoat"
"That's possible, but a scapegoat general is innocent - that's to be determined."
"When did all this start"
~Felix asked~
"Flanagan?"
*Lenny turned his head*
"About 24 hours ago"
~Lenny said~
"I mean, I've had Rossin for longer than that."
~A quite spread as attention turned toward martha.~
"how long?"
~Flanagan asked~
"I think it was about 50 hours now, more or less"
~Rossin offered~
"About double that"
"That seems relevant."
~Said lenny.~
*Flanagan turned to the door.*
"Excuse me, it seems we have another guest."
~Flanagan paused~
"A less than welcome one."
"Who?"
~Said Jochek~
"Uri, he's in the elevator now."
`"Who's uri?"`
*Rossin turned to her.*
"You want to try it yourself? 
Give that board a whirl."
*Martha nodded.*
'Okay, so...
need to just write a thing that will ask the right question?'
`"Who is Uri?"`
~She waited with dwindling hope.~
'That did nothing...'
`"Am I missing something?"`
"Two things, one - you're still saying the command on the board - with your words..."
`'Okay - so thoughts?'`
"You are going to learn to use more detailed questions if you use words.
Which is why you need to more than just thoughts and words."
`"What else is there?"`
"A fair bit, now listen, everyone else is."
~Around her Martha realized everyone was silent - watching the door.~
"Martha - can you get a little more anxious"
"What?"
~Everyone turned to her.~
'Well, that would do it.'
`--H();`
~A oscillation rising in pitch faded out of range, her heartbeat thundered in her chest~
~Colors filled her vision - filling in spatially where sounds originated~
~A color for every sound.~
*A metallic click in the background - from the door.*
*A panting, rhythmic and low*
~She focused on the door.~
"Is he secure?"
"For now: is the Relux here?"
~There was a moments hesitation~
"Why do you ask?"
"They need to disconnect."
~The door opened, and Flanagan was joined by a stout potato of a man~
~By his side was a labrador - feet skittering across the green and purple marble floor~
"Alice was succeeded then?"
"No... well, yes.. but No."
*Flanagan and Uri returned to the room - the labrador whimpering for food.*
"There's no chocolate on the table - should be fine."
~Uri released the leash.~
"Sorry everyone - hope you like dogs."
~Felix shook his head~
"Oh good you are here - you need to disconnect: right now."
"And why would we do that."
~Uri paused, then turned to Flanagan.~
"He can't explain until you've disconnected."
~Lenny looked from   to Flanagan~
"We aren't all together - one of us is in Romania."
~Uri inhaled just a bit too sharply at that.~
"That's not ideal: have them make their way back here."
~Uri waited, the dog feasted on the bits of bread and cheese on the center table.~
~Both Joeck and Lenny stretched their necks in unison~
"It's done."
"Now why did we do that?"
~Lenny asked.~
*Uri made his way to sit down, everyone else shifted around him.*
*He sighed and poured himself a cup of tea*
"Well Uri?"
~Felix asked.~
"I'm not Uri."
*He look a sip a tea*
~Felix wrinkled his face trying to squeeze a better view out of his eyes.~
"Let me explain: We can't use the link - it's not safe."
"I wouldn't call the link safe"
~Felix interjected~
"It's being taken over - by something very dangerous."
~Martha leaned back~
*Martha yawned*
~Again everyone looked at her and again her hearing was impeccable.~
'What does that mean for Alacira?'
~Martha mused.~
