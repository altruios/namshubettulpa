# RESTRUCTURING

{
"If Flanagan made the undernet then isn't he in charge of them? "
~The cab driver was excellent at weaving through traffic.~
~His face frozen, his eyes though...~
*His eyes repeatedly scanned back and forth.*
~The driver side window was rolled down, wind roaring in.~
'Maybe the wind drowned me out'
"If Flanagan made the -"
~Felix cut her off.~
"It's possible."
~He leaned in the back seat.~
~Rossin was taking up the other back seat.~
*Rossin shook his head.*
"I don't think it's likely...
When you meet Flanagan, you'll understand."
~Felix said.~
"So he's ignorant of what they're doing?"
*Felix immidiatly shook his head*
"No: he knows, at least he'd better.
We just don't know what his plan is right now...
because we...
I, am a bit out of the loop."
*Rossin displayed his palms*
~His position was one of 'whatda gonna do?'~
"I litterally choose him at random...
random from a pool of people with the right Admin priviliages."
`"So you didn't vet him?"`
*Rossin mimed looking around*
"When would I find the time?
I've been talking to you all day."
`"you're a programm, cant you do things at like...
the speed of thought or whatever?"`
"You do things at the speed of thought."
~Martha paused.~
'Fuck'
`"Good point"`
*Felix repeatedly tapped his finger on his leg.*
"So I know Flanagan didn't...
He didn't kill my author...
But someone he knows probably did."
`"Why do you say that?"`
"the thing that attacked my author, it left...
sharp edges in me...
there are large chunks of me just...
missing.
I can see how much is missing, and...
I'm..."
~Rossin stopped at that point and sat there with his head down~
*Martha fell to her right, Felix did as well, Rossin sat balanced.*
"We are...
just about..."
*The cabbie pulled into an alley, then a garage entrance*
"Here."

{
~flouresent lights and floors of concrete lower they reached the bottom.~
"You don't have any weapons on you, right - leave them in the car otherwise."
~Martha was about to protest, but felt the weight of the gun at her side.~
~She slid it out and dropped it under the seat, giving it a little kick also.~
*Felix nodded, and opened the door.*
*He held out her hand toward her, as she slid herself across the seat.*
~The car was parked blocking some cars in on Martha's side.~
~To her right was the entrance to a little cave alcove containing elevators.~
"Don't look away from the security guard, blinking is fine...
But keep your eyes on him."
*Martha tilted her head but nodded.*
*They approched the elevators.*
"He's really serious about that, by the way... 
don't look away, not even internally to write on the board."
`'Why?'`
~Martha noticed the color of that screen change~
`'Why is that a different color now?'`
"That?"
`'This screen.'`
"That's you thinking at me vesus you talking at me...
Oh, and other why is because then we die."
~Inside was a single security guard, sitting in a folding chair.~
"His eyes, Martha - keep looking at his eyes."
*Rossin said, pointing at the security guard.*
~She did, although he was not looking at her.~
~He had his feet up on another folding chair, with a newspaper in his hands.~
"Hello, we're here to see Flannagan."
*The security guard folded his newspaper, and took a small sip of coffee.*
*He placed the cup down on a third fold up chair and sighed.*
"Name."
"Felix"
~A small pause.~
*Felix tapped his foot against hers.*
"Martha."
~Another small pause.~
~Martha noticed small twitches in the guards eyes, his eyes dialating wildly.~
"Go."
*He picked up his coffee again and took another sip.*
*Felix stepped backwards toward the elevator behind him and pressed the button.*
*The security guard put down his cup and tossed Felix the key from his pocket.*
*Felix nodded, as he caught it.*
~The elevator door gave a ding and the light above lit.~
"Martha!"
*Felix called.*
"Backwards Martha - keep you're eyes on the guard - long as you can see him."
*Rossin said.*
*Martha stepped backwards towards Felix.*
*The doors swung open, Felix and Martha stepped inside.*
~Moments later, when the door was closed, and they're eyes could move again:~
"What happened to us being gods?"
"Some gods are stronger than others."
*He pressed the key into a slot and turned.*
~The elevator made a clanking noice, and fell downward, lurching Martha's lunch.~
*She held on to the siderailing across from Felix who was doing the same.*
~The elevator slowed over time, and eventually came to a gental rest.~
~And above them through the speakers emitted an annoyingly chirpy ding.~
*The doors opened, and Felix and Martha walked out.*

~Kent sat alone on a park bench.~
*He glanced at his watch between chews of his bagal.*
'Two-thirty, let me see...
4pm would hit the 12 hour mark of day 2.'
~He briefly considered taking a small nap on the bench...~
~But decided he would stay at a hotel.~
*He stood up, and walked along the city edge*
~He could afford a few hours yet...~
'Somewhere close by.'
~He scanned the streets beyond the park.~
~In the short distance he saw a hotel sign - dolphin.~
'A bit ritzy but that is close.'
~Down beyond the sign in front of the main entrance something caught Kent's eye~
~A shorter woman was holding out a phone in front of her like a shield...~
'No - more like a weapon.'
~She held out her phone facing an older gentleman of 60's in a dapper suit.~
~He stared slackjawed at it - unmoving.~
*Kent moved closer to the entrance, recongnizing this phone business from Felix.*
~Suddenly the older man sprang to life.~
*She switched phones with him, and Kent saw him enter his password for her.*
*A moment later she took her phone back and walked off.* 
~Leaving the man stupified.~
*Kent navigated the river of cars - which was gridlocked, and reached the old man.*
~The man shook his head - like he was trying to get water out of his ear.~
"Can you tell me anything about that woman?"
*Kent approched and flashed his badge*
~It was a quick flash - he wasn't NYPD.~
~The man tilted his head slightly~
"What woman?"
*Kent sighed and brushed past him - rounding the corner where she had turned.*
~He was in an alley - the woman, she wore a red cadigan, was at a metal door at the end.~
'Was she always wearing a red carigan?'
~Kent used the edged of his foot, walking quitely as possible~
*He approched behind her, she was entering a code on a keypad*
*The door hissed open.* 
*she opened then walked through the door.*
~Kent was close enough to the door to make a dash for it~
*He did.*
~his finger fit in to stop the door slamming shut.~
'Bad idea Kent'
*Kent opened the door slightly and peered inside*
~A dimly lit hallway - and no person or camera in sight.~
*He opened the door a bit more.*
~There was nothing around the edged of the room, just a hallway.~
*He slid through the opening and closed the door gentley.*
'This is a really bad idea Kent.'
'You know those horror movies where the person goes in alone into the den of a lion?'
'that is you right now: this is what is going on.'
'you have not had sleep in: how long?'
'Come on Kent - get out of here.'
~Kent pushed forward.~
'What if another zombie thing shows up: no gun Kent.'
~He was momentairly back in that hallway - shooting at that bloody thing rushing him.~
~He shook the thought away.~
*Kent walked down the hall - and looked around the corner at the end.*
~He could hear sounds - jovial.~
~He could see a small gathering of beanbag chairs in a circle.~
~Some were empty - but most were filled with people.~
~Surrounding them were chalkboards, covered in writing~
~He was too far away to make out the writing.~
~He felt a hand on his shoulder.~
"first time?"
~Kent turned his head to see another Woman right behind him.~
*He nodded.*
'Okay - go with the flow - act like you belong...'
'stay calm: do not freak out.'
"Come."
*She placed her hand on Kent's back.*
"How'd you find us?"
'Fuck - 2 seconds in and already panicking.'
'37 hours awake?'
'is that right?'
'she is looking at you - answer: anything!'
"oh, you know: saw some stuff... 
read some stuff...
put two and two together..."
*He was led by her to sit down in on of the bean bags.*
~Around him was a stotastic wave of interest...~
~Expressed as a void, a gap in conversation...~ 
~A subtle look, often followed by an 'anyway'~
"We start in a few moments, I'll let you get settled."
*She herself walked to the other side of the room.*
*And then distributed paper amoung those sitting.*
~One paper reached Kent's hands as he passed the rest over.~
"Hi, I'm Robert."
~A voice came from his left.~
"Kent."
~Kent distractedly replied - reading though the paper.~
~Then the writing on the boards.~

{
~A long hallway entrance in victorian wood lit by candle light~
~At the end: a mahogangy door.~
*Felix walked up to the door, Martha at his side.*
*Felix paused.*
"You ready?"
~Before she could respond a creaking came from in front of them.~
*The door swung open by a man in a robe.*
~A bath robe.~
"Enter and palavar for a time."
"Hello Flanagan, how are things?"
*Flanagan shifted his robe, and leaned against the door, inviting them in.*
"better now that you've brought her."
~Martha stiffened at that.~
"Tell me Martha.
What's his name?"
*Felix cocked his head toward her and raised an eyebrow.*
"You know me..."
"damn it Felix, not you...
Go wait for the rest of us inside.
I have to be sure of something before she enters."
*Felix bowed his head, and scampered off inside.*
~Flanagan waited, inspecting her.~
"so... what's his name?"
"He means me, just tell him the Truth."
*Rossin walked forward toward Flanagan.*
"Rossin."
"Rossin... and he's been helpful?"
~Martha paused considering.~
*Rossin at her side started pacing back and forth.*
"I mean...
yes.
yes...
he has been helpful..."
'hold on a sec...'
"If by helpful you mean flinging me into a bunch of bullshit trouble...
then yeah: super helpful."
*Flanagan blinked, then barked a high pitch laugh*
'more of a squeel than a laugh'
"There is some bullshit going on yes...
But we're in the middle of cleaning that up."
*Flanagan inspected the air around her, then waved her forward.*
"Come on in, I can at least patch over some of the leaking...
If he wants."
*He stepped back into the room - leaving the door open.*
*Martha followed.*
`"what just happened?"`
"deep scan: deep look at my pattern..."
`"and"`
"and he doesn't kill us: which is good."
~Before the hallway was cast in a golden light eminating from the room.~
~It was bright enough to be blinding, that didn't make sense to her.~
~as she stepped in it was like a switch had been fliiped and she could see.~
"...oh what the fuck."
~The room was atrociously decorated in the most garrish wallpaper imaginable.~
~Purple against green uneven and unparrellal lines covered the wall.~
~nothing was a right angle.~
~Everywhere the eye look every burned into her brain.~
"It's a landing pad."
*rossin said as he walked down the little alcove stairs in the left.*
"Watch your step on these..."
`"landing pad?"`
*rossin poked his head back inside this small section of the room*
"It's a place - a place you burn in a bunch of people's brain...
and you...
land there - if you need to...
if you die."
~Flanagan was at the threshold to another entrance, Felix at a chair beyond.~
"come on now, we don't have all day"
*rossin walked over and then next to her as she sat down next to felix.*
"That's a culture thing: a landing pad is a dominance thing...
Sort of a 'if I die I can come for your body from your dreams', kind of thing."
~Martha paused briefly, she nearly sat down before she hesitated.~
`"that's a little fucked."`
*Rossin nodded his head.*
*Martha sat down next to Felix.*
~Flanagan was about to speak when a chime rang.~
"Oh, that would be two of the Relux"
"Where's the third"
~Felix inquired.~
"Still in Romania: now If you'll excuse me."
~After Flanagan left the room for the center door, Martha asked:~
"Relux?"
"Name of a hivemind - three people sharing three bodies."
~Martha paused.~
"Can anyone do that?"
*Felix raised his hand and shook it noncommitally.*
"Theoretically, yeah - but it's sort of: well."
~Felix paused.~
"you don't get large groups or many groups because well: just imagine..."
*Martha waved him on.*
"imagine if you can hear someone's thoughts - no filter.
every bad nasty thing thought in passing that doesnt get said:
most people are at each others throats with that level of connectivity"
"so it's a constant connection - you can't turn it on or off?"
"This I'm not that famimilar with - thought never appealed to me: so I didn't learn more."
~Martha sat in silence for a time - pondering what that would be like.~
"I mean - I'm just in your head - our thoughts aren't connected"
*Rossin sat down beside her*
"So imagine this: but more extreme. just"
*Rossin puts up a mock hand and jabbers with it*
"gibberish all day - most people - even the Awakened: their thoughts are a mess."
~Through the threshold step Flanagan and Two people next to him.~
~A burely man - dark skin and curly black hair, and a thin tall blonde beside him.~
*They stepped forward and sat on the couch across from them*
*Felix rose to take their hands, and with only a subtle prompting from Rossin, Martha did likewise*
"Relux, What's the news?"
*Felix said sitting back down*
*The man turned to Flannagan*
"how much does he know?"
"I haven't had time to question them, you arrived shortly after."
"question us about what the school? that's why we're here - we just came from there."
"It was more than just the school in new york"
"what, the one in london?"
"it was more than just the schools, though they were all hit."
~Felix fell silent~
"What all was attacked?"
~Martha asked.~
"The schools, a number of hubs, assassinations... you were one of the first we think."
"me?"
"I think he means me, my author I mean."
"I mean Rossin."
"who's Rossin?"
~Felix asked~
"The first assissination victim - what's left of him is in Martha over here."
*Felix turned to Martha.*
"So all this time?"
"Speaking of, he's leaking pretty badly - Jochek - would you?"
*The blone woman nodded and held out her hand*
"I don't bite"
"It's alright - I need some fixing"
~Rossin said.~
*Martha reached out her hand and clasped Jochek's*
~for a moment time seized, stuttering a jerking to a halt~
~Rossin faded from view and time jerked back~
~her left eye was close - she couldn't open it~
"How long should this take?"
~a wave a nausia passed her.~
"Not that much longer."
~Flannagain turned back from the other Relux, looking back at martha.~
"do we need a bag?"
*Felix asked looking around*
*Martha waved him no*
'hold a thought, hold your stomach, hold your breath'
~The dusty memeory of her mother's drinking song, was the very thought she held~
~the nausia passed eventually~
~Replaced by a coldness~
"Okay, that should just about do it"
~Moments passed and Rossin didn't appear~
"Now that's taken care of, to the matter at hand. we think we lost about two thirds"
"two thirds of?"
~Jochek asked~
"of the Awakened"
~Flannagan said flatly~
~At the table in front of them was a teaset.~
*Flannagan sat down and poured himself a cup.*
"I say we think, because it's hard to say exactly"
"You can't remember them"
~Martha found herself speaking before she realized~
*Flannagan nodded*
"I can't even remember Rossin"
"Oh that's not good"
~Rossin was sitting beside her now~
`"you alright?"`
"Never better... well, not that I remember"
"We know the loses by the absence of where they should be, physically and in memory"
*Flannagan took a sip of tea*
"And in my case I had something more concrete to measure by, sample by... it's about two thirds"
*Rossin leaned over*
"landing pad - more than likely"
`"how"`
`{todo:link to description of how that works}`
~Both the Relux's hands reached for the teapot - before only Jochek pouring themselves cups put it back~
"We haven't noticed anything in Romania"
*Flanagan nodded*
"Still though, look for signs of missing things"
"We saw them, at the tower."
~Felix said quitely~
"burned into their foreheads was a message - underestimated undernet"
*Flannagan put down the teacup*
"I believe there to be an outside influence - a strong one - manipulating the undernet.
the leaders of the undernet being led along towards us."
"two thirds..."
~Felix Exclaimed~
"two thirds scrambled, at once... so we know it was the undernet?"
*The male Relux leaned forward and spoke*
"more complicated: they're involved, but they don't have the numbers to pull something like this off, and how?"
*He shook his head*
"no, and who did they scamble - and why: you know what i think - coup"
"nail on the head and winds from my sails, lenny, I think it's a coup too, and the undernet is being pushed in the spotlight"
*Jochek leaned in*
"underestimated undernet was in all the schools"

{
`~
a few critical choices are made here narratively:
the relation of Felix to Flanagan.
the relation of Rossin to Flanagan.


in any event - Felix is tasked by Falstine and others ( teachers?) to clean out the undernet.
clean it from influance of whatever is giving them actually useful info...
not actually get rid of it.

Martha comes along with Felix and a few teachers now with only her as a pupil.

here we also meet the teachers - described in the characters section.

restructuring reffers to the group dynamic at play going forward - adding the 3 teachers into the mix.
also they are kind of one person - but not really - sort of a ref to a katet from the dark tower refference.
three minds sharing three bodies interchangably.
so the only secrets they have from each other are their own thoughts.
they've seen everything the other has seen for a long time now.
couple of things they will probably do at some point.
1. 2 people have control of one person fighting a group of people. while third controls breathing.
2. 1 person controls 3 due to specific personal knowledge. (unknown scenerio where that plays out)
3. 1 of their bodies die.
4. 1 of their minds die - different than body.
