# RESTRUCTURING

{
`in this chapter we have a conversation with Flanagan.
a few critical choices are made here narratively:
felix's relation to Flanagan.
Rossin's relation to Flanagan.


in any event - Felix is tasked by Falstine and others ( teachers?) to clean out the undernet.
Martha comes along with Felix and a few teachers now with only her as a pupil.

here we also meet the teachers - described in the characters section.

restructuring reffers to the group dynamic at play going forward - adding the 3 teachers into the mix.
