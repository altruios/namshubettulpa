# RESTRUCTURING

{
"If Flanagan made the undernet then isn't he in charge of them? "
~The cab driver was excellent at weaving through traffic.~
~His face frozen, his eyes though...~
*His eyes repeatedly scanned back and forth.*
~The driver side window was rolled down, wind roaring in.~
'Maybe the wind drowned me out'
"If Flanagan made the -"
~Felix cut her off.~
"It's possible."
~He leaned in the back seat.~
~Rossin was taking up the other back seat.~
*Rossin shook his head.*
"I don't think it's likely...
When you meet Flanagan, you'll understand."
~Felix said.~
"So he's ignorant of what they're doing?"
*Felix immidiatly shook his head*
"No: he knows, at least he better.
We just don't know what his plan is right now...
because we...
I, am a bit out of the loop."
*Rossin displayed his palms*
~His position was one of 'whatda gonna do?'~
"I litterally choose him at random...
random from a pool of people with the right Admin priviliages."
`"So you didn't vet him?"`
*Rossin mimed looking around*
"When would I find the time?
I've been talking to you all day."
`"you're a programm, cant you do things at like...
the speed of thought or whatever?"`
"You do things at the speed of thought."
~Martha paused.~
'Fuck'
`"Good point"`
*Felix repeatedly tapped his finger on his leg.*
"So I know Flanagan didn't...
He didn't kill my author...
But someone he knows probably did."
`"Why do you say that?"`
"the thing that attacked my author, it left...
sharp edges in me...
there are large chunks of me just...
missing.
I can see how much is missing, and...
I'm..."
~Rossin stopped at that point and sat there with his head down~
*Martha fell to her right, Felix did as well, Rossin sat balanced.*
"We are...
just about..."
*The cabbie pulled into an alley, then a garage entrance*
"Here."

`security worldbuilding scene goes here`

{
~A long hallway entrance in victorian wood lit by candle light~
~At the end: a mahogangy door.~
*Felix walked up to the door, Martha at his side.*
*Felix paused.*
"You ready?"
~Before she could respond a creaking came from in front of them.~
*The door swung open by a man in a robe.*
~A bath robe.~
"Enter and palavar for a time."
"Hello Flanagan, how are things?"
*Flanagan shifted his robe, and leaned against the door, inviting them in.*
"better now that you've brought her."
~Martha stiffened at that.~
"Tell me Martha.
What's his name?"
*Felix cocked his head toward her and raised an eyebrow.*
"You know me..."
"damn it felix, not you...
Go wait for us inside.
I have to be sure of something before she enters."
*Felix bowed his head, and scampered off inside.*
~Flanagan waited, inspecting her.~
"so... what's his name?"
"He means me."
*Rossin walked forward toward Flanagan.*
"Rossin."
"Rossin... and he's been helpful?"
~Martha paused considering.~
*Rossin at her side started pacing back and forth.*
"I mean...
yes.
yes...
he has been helpful..."
'hold on a sec...'
"If by helpful you mean flinging me into a bunch of bullshit trouble...
then yeah: super helpful."
*Flanagan blinked, then barked a high pitch laugh*
'more of a squeel than a laugh'
"There is some bullshit going on yes...
But we're in the middle of cleaning that up."
*Flanagan inspected the air around her, then waved her forward.*
"Come on in, I can at least patch over some of the leaking...
If he wants."
*He stepped back into the room - leaving the door open.*
*Martha followed.*
~Before the hallway was cast in a golden light eminating from the room.~
~It was bright enough to be blinding, that didn't make sense to her.~
~as she stepped in it was like a switch had been fliiped and she could see.~
"...oh what the fuck."
~The room was atrociously decorated in the most garrish wallpaper imaginable.~
~Purple against green uneven and unparrellal lines covered the wall.~
~nothing was a right angle.~
~Everywhere the eye look every burned into her brain.~
"It's a landing pad."
*rossin said as he walked down the little alcove stairs in the left.*
"Watch your step on these..."
`"landing pad?"`
*rossin poked his head back inside this small section of the room*
"It's a place - a place you burn in a bunch of people's brain...
and you...
land there - if you need to...
if you die."
~Flanagan was at the threshold to another entrance, Felix at a chair beyond.~
"come on now, we don't have all day"
*rossin walked over and then next to her as she sat down next to felix.*
"That's a culture thing: a landing pad is a dominance thing...
If I die I can come for your body from your dreams."
~Martha paused briefly, she nearly sat down before she hesitated.~
`"that's a little fucked."`
*Rossin nodded his head.*

{
a few critical choices are made here narratively:
felix's relation to Flanagan.
Rossin's relation to Flanagan.


in any event - Felix is tasked by Falstine and others ( teachers?) to clean out the undernet.
Martha comes along with Felix and a few teachers now with only her as a pupil.

here we also meet the teachers - described in the characters section.

restructuring reffers to the group dynamic at play going forward - adding the 3 teachers into the mix.
