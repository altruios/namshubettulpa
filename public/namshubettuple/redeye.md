# REDEYE
{
~Martha was walking on top of a cliff face.~
~the wind in her face and the sun on her back.~
~In front of her was a long cylindrical spacecraft.~
~It jutting out from the crash site at the side of the cliff below her.~
~It was covered with hexagonal glass windows.~
~the entire shape bubbled out in strange directions - not aerodynamic at all.~
*She made her decent, until landing on the top of the ship.*
~to her right was an entrance: a broken hub of glass...~
~some sort of window.~
*Navigating the broken glass she rolled as gently as she could inside the ship.*
~inside the emergency lights were a steady red.~
~she had no flashlight.~
~A long hallway descending deep into the mountain.~
~side doors, broken off their hinges covered the floor.~
*She descended into the red.*
~The end of the tunnel was blocked off.~
~Jammed shut by a door she couldn’t move.~
~To her right was a service hatch.~
~it was half way down and half her size...~
~a crawlspace for the electricals.~
*She popped it open and a hiss of air came out.*
~it had an odor to it: stale, damp...~
~of dead mold and old things.~
*She crawled in.*
~She was on her hands and knees - struggling to move forward.~
~the tunnel clearly not meant for her size.~
~The walls jutted out in strange directions from the crash.~
~they reminding her of the sliding mechanism for a drawer...~
~only much more jagged.~
~The red lights shown in here too - dimmer than the main passage.~
~it was unable to light the dark hole in front of her.~
~As she grew closer she saw the opening was a narrow spot.~
~one she just barely fit though.~
~beyond was a short circular room the shape of a coin.~
*She tumbled out, hunching over doing a sort of crab walk to continue on.*
~She heard rustling behind her.~
*Turning, she found nothing.*
~To her left was a squeak, she found it - a small rodent.~
'How was she going to get it out?'
~It sat on its hind legs and was a cross between a squirrel and a beaver...~
~grey in color with extremely large eyes wider than she had ever seen.~
~Those eyes looked at her, reflected her in them.~
*And it scampered off, to the side of the room.*
~there were only two exits...~
~stacked on top of each other.~
~the entrance she tumbled though being the one above.~
~She heard a noise again, behind her.~
~Something large moving in one of the tunnels.~
~Behind her were stacked entrances.~
*she fell from the top one, but something was there below.*
~A glistening black form, that hid against the busted lights.~
~All she could tell was it was moving...~
~toward her.~
*She backed against the opposite side of the room.*
*The rodent scampered away from her.*
*it changed direction back towards her as a figure slammed into the threshold.*
*Clawing at it, trying to get through, though it was too big.*
~She couldn’t make it out...~
~but it had a long row of teeth that she could see...~
~Reflecting purely the red light.~
~Its head could not fit through the opening.~
~and it’s tiny claw couldn’t swipe far enough to reach her.~
*It opened its mouth.*
*and another set of teeth reached out with an appendage in its mouth.*
~She stared at it, it couldn’t reach her and she could only watch.~
*The rodent by her side was terrified.*
~the only way out now was just above the creature - the way she had come.~
'Where had she seen this before?'
~She felt a familiar tinge of nostalgia.~
}
{
~She felt herself sliding back - through the metal.~
*She kept falling backwards - further into the mountain.*
~The rock twisted and became sparse.~
~purple lightning strikes between the dust particles swirling about in the air.~
*She twisted around to see she was heading towards a barrier.*
~something like a soap bubble.~
~The torrent wailed against her until she passed that threshold.~
~then all was silence as she slowly fell toward the deck of the ship below.~
~She angled herself to be standing when she landed.~
~Memory flooding back into her.~
~that she was in a dream, that she had been here before.~
~And before her stood captain Alacira, smiling.~
"First things first, put this in your ear. 
Then think of the last place I sent you"
*she handed Martha a small brass...*
'horn?'
*She took it and did as instructed, remembering the monastery with the monks.*
~A swirling cloud of color poured out of the horn.~
~And behind her Gerald Whitewater was there to capture that with a jar.~
*He closed the lid - and took the horn from martha.*
"Just in case we forgot something,"
~Gerald said.~
*Taking both carefully while also balancing a clipboard under his arm.*
"Same timeframe as before - what was it this time?"
~Alacira asked.~
"What?"
"What was the thing in your head posing as this time?"
"An alien"
~the words came to her - remembering that movie.~
*Alacira nodded, moving back to the center of the ship, and Martha followed.*
"That thing...
it’s not what you see, it’s just wearing a costume. 
don’t make assumptions about what’s underneath based on what it wears. 
where to gerald?"
*Gerald stumbled about - shifting the horn and clipboard’s place.*
*He lifted a few pages,*
"13,i4...
you’ll have a navigator this time, make sure to stay with him - alright?"
~he said just as they reached the elevator.~
"Navigator?"
~Martha asked.~
"Grab the railing"
*Alacira said - punching in the numbers on the panel.*
"He’s waiting at the entrance"
*Gerald said - shuffling the horn between his legs.*
*he tucked in the clipboard back under his armpit as they ascended.*
*He placed his hand on the railing.*
*Martha fell into the side of the elevator.*
*Gerald reached out for her.*
~she felt her stomach lurch at a sudden weightless sensation.~
~The clipboard went flying to the ceiling.~
*Gerald grabbed her hand - and placed it on the railing.*
*She fell into him.*
*She looked up at the clipboard.*
*it was barreling back toward her and Gerald caught it...*
~almost nonchilantly...~
~almost.~
*He caught it with his face first, then his free hand.*
"What was that?"
"We had to rotate a bit, that’s what the railing is for."
~he said meekly.~
"Do as I say, when I say...
get used to that...
we don’t have time to explain everything to you...
just what you need to know"
*the doors opened.*
}
{
~Beyond them was a hallway stretching on into the dark like before.~
~but this one was lined with snowglobes: glowing with a faint blue static.~
~In front of them - to the left, was a man she could have sworn she recognized.~
~a tall thin man in an overcoat - rubbing the back of his head.~
~She just couldn’t place him.~
"The navigator?"
*she asked, he bowed.*
"He doesn’t speak,"
*Gerald said, moving forward.*
}
{
~He stopped at a single dark and empty snow globe.~
*he placed the horn on top of it and emptied the jar’s contents into the horn.*
~Below the snowglobe began to glow.~
~Looking inside she could see the monastery as it had been just before the fire.~
"These are...
...Dreams.
some of them the last anyone has had"
~Gerald said.~
}
{
"Gerald - which number?"
"Right,"
~he glanced back at his clipboard,~
"42.
It’s on our right."
~They walked on, down that silent hallway.~
~the only lights that flickering blue from the snow globes.~
"I swear I know you."
~Martha said, studying the tall man.~
*He looked at her, shrugged, then looked at alacira quizzically.*
"I doubt it - unless you know many coma patients?"
*Martha shook her head - still staring at the navigator.*
~he glanced at her, not fully comfortable with her gaze.~
~It was on the tip of her brain.~
"We’re here."
~Gerald said.~
}
{
~Looking at the gold plate inlaid below Martha saw it read 42.~
~The snowglobe lay on the pedestal before her. ~
~it showed a network of twisting interlocking gears.~
"What am I looking for - another book?"
*Gerald shook his head,*
"this one might be harder to find...
we don’t exactly know this time.
This isn’t going to be like your last time...
this is far less solid.
It’s a dream...
his dream actually...
so out of place things...
are less out of place there..."
*Gerald gestured toward the navigator who straightened his tie,*
"that’s why he’s going with you."
~Captain alacira studied at her pocket watch.~
~Martha heard a small crash in the distance, like thunder only deeper.~
"That’s the first threshold - we can’t keep her here much longer."
*Gerald nodded.*
}
{
"If you get in trouble: Kent here will take you back,"
*Gerald took her hand and placed it in Kent’s.*
*and before Martha could speak - he placed both on the snow globe.*
"Good luck,"
~was the last she heard before a feeling of cold ice permeated her skin.~
}
{

}
{
~Kent watched the evening’s flight unfold.~
~He had seen what was on Felix’s phone...~
~and he played along - following literally everyone else’s lead...~
'where they were all doing the same?'
'Was this a case of a mass confidence trick?'
'No - this was something else...'
~Everyone's left eye had twitched and then they donned a blank stare.~
~when it was his turn he did the same - he was sure the other’s weren’t faking.~
}
{
~Felix - he learned his name - was an ass.~
~Doing childish games with the completely docile passengers.~
~Ordering them about for his amusement.~
~Kent grew sick at some of the games.~
~Thankful he was in the back: far away from Felix.~
}
{
~He had to pee, he had to sleep.~
~and yet he could do neither without blowing his cover.~
~His vision was blurry, and his bladder pressed at him begging for release.~
~He wished he stopped by the restroom first thing, but...~
'too late for that.'
}
{
~When Felix wasn’t looking in his direction: He did an old army trick.~
*he shifted his leg over the other.*
*quietly and carefully he squeezed them together.*
~It barely helped.~
}
{
~It was another hour before Felix grew uninterested.~
~eventually Felix leaned his chair back to go to sleep.~
~No one else moved a muscle.~
*When he was sure he was asleep - Kent danced over the still passengers.*
~He moved as quietly as he could without releasing his bladder accidentally.~
*he made his way back to the restroom in the back of the plane.*
~he did not trust the restroom in front next to felix to be quiet enough.~
*he walked into coach.*
~before him everyone was unnaturally still.~
}
{
*He made his way down the aisle.*
'pretend they are normal - talking with each other.'
*he opened the door to the bathroom.*
~unsuprisingly the staff area in the back were also completely still.~
*He shuddered and closed the door.*
*While washing his hands his holster sagged just a little, he had a thought.*
}
{
*he finished drying his hands.*
*he went out into coach and started looking at the passengers,*
~really looking at them...~
'Which one are you, damn it,'
*he thought, moving slowly across the middle seats.*
~He imagined they would be near the back.~
~with a good view of everyone else.~
*but frisking everyone so far yielded nothing.*
*Methodically he made his way towards the front of the plane: looking for...*
~his left hand felt something solid.~
~it was underneath the jacket of the man in the window seat about half way up.~
"Sorry about this,"
*he said, unbuttoning the sky marshal's jacket and taking the glock.*
"I’ll send it back..."
*Kent awkwardly reached around and felt at the man’s ass.*
~There was no wallet.~
*checking his coat next Kent found a billfold in his inner breast pocket.*
*He snapped a picture of the license with his phone then placed it back.*
}
{
*He put the gun into his holster.*
*then he walked quietly back to first class: desperate to get some sleep...*
~and he realized...~
~no one had their eyes closed.~
~Could he afford to sleep right now.~
~No - no he could not...~
*he sighed, and walked to the back of the plane.*
}
{
~He was pretty sure they had coffee...~
~or at least the ability to make coffee in the back of the plane.~
}
{
%%%%
}
{
*Martha landed in the center of a golden metal gear.*
*She braced her fall while the navigator slowly floated down to meet her.*
"Kent?"
*she asked, and he nodded.*
~It came flooding back...~
~the cop at the precinct - the one who was immune to hooks...~
'What was he doing here?'
"Why are you here?"
~she demanded.~
}
{
"Are you following me?"
*He raised his hands in a confused gesture.*
*and he mimed that he wasn’t - that he just met her.*
~He didn’t speak - not with words...~
~but his hands, his whole body even, were excellent at conveying meaning...~
~a regular charlie chaplin.~
*The floor below them twisted.*
~all around them were spinning interlocking gears, fading into blackness.~
~there was no obvious light source.~
~Ther was just a faint glow all around that grew dimmer with distance.~
}
{
~Martha regained her balance.~
~Kent - or the navigator - just stood there easily keeping his.~
*He gestured with his head, she should follow him.*
*he walked off to the edge of the gear.*
*he looked back with an expectant look.*
"Where are we going?"
~she asked.~
*He mimed out his death.*
*then stepped over the ledge.*
*he twisted strangly in the air to stand on the edge of the giant gear.*
~rotated 90 degrees from Martha's perspective.~
*Martha went to the edge of the gear.*
*Kent walking slowly back toward where the teeth met - waiting for her.*
'Here goes nothing,'
*she thought, following Kent’s leap over the edge.*
~she felt herself falling forward, not downward.~
~and soon she found herself on top of the teeth...~
~and then just as quickly on the underside of the gear.~
}
{
*Kent held out his hand over the side.*
*he helped her slide back onto the teeth.*
~the gear jolted again, backwards toward interlocking teeth.~
*She lost her balance and fell forward.*
~her feet were just under where the gears met...~
~not crushed, but by just the barest amount.~
~She had to wait for the gears to go forward again before pulling them out.~
*when the teeth rotated enough she threw herself up with Kent’s helping hand.*
*Kent dusted himself off.*
*with a more urgent tilt of the head he mined: hurry up...*
~that’s only going to get worse.~
}
{
~A part of Martha was amazed at how well he communicated - without using words.~
*They made their way along the edge.*
~until they met another gear on the other side...~
~this one mostly facing to their right.~
*With a skip and a hop Kent jumped just so - and landed on that gear’s teeth.*
*With his hand out and some prep time Martha made the jump.*
*When she landed Kent more urgently ran - Martha in tow.*
}
{
~A moment later the gears skipped backwards again.~
~and this time Martha saw a ripple in the other gears around her.~
~the wavelike effect gave her some warning.~
"What’s causing that?"
~Martha asked after it passed.~
*Kent only mimed things breaking down, breaking apart.*
*They made their way through the gears.*
~each slip getting more jarring.~
~each time the gears fell further back.~
~He did say it would get worse.~
}
{
~One of the gears to her left started flying toward her - twisting in the air.~
*Kent jumped at her.*
*he knocked her to the backside of the gear...*
~opposite where the one flying at her would hit.~
~A resounding ringing echoed against her skin.~
~the metal below her vibrated and all around her gears started twisting...~
~no they were stationary: ~
'shit - this one was coming loose.'
}
{
*Kent pulled her to her feet.*
*they ran across the flat to the nearest connected gear.*
*Kent - still holding her hand, grabbed around her back.*
*he led them to jump for the face of that gear.*
~They landed in an awkward roll, the wind knocked out of Martha.~
~She looked back to where they had just been only to see darkness.~
~she heard loud clattering from below...~
~which moved to her left now, but she was sure that was down at this point.~
*Kent got up, and helped her to her feet - inspecting her for any damage.*
~He mimed looking at a watch and tilted his head more urgently.~
}
{
*He ran - looking back as Martha started forward to match his pace.*
~She felt something - a dread she remembered from a distant dream.~
~!A prickeling on the back of the neck.!~
~Not wanting to turn around, not wanting to face it she caught up to Kent.~
~he had just jumped onto another gear’s teeth.~
"I think it’s here,"
~Martha said.~
*Kent nodded, pointed to his eye, then behind her.*
*Then waved her forward.*
*She jumped and landed where he was.*
~They were running now and Martha noticed the wave of gears slipping.~
*she stopped while Kent did not.*
}
{
*He fell sideways, falling onto the flat of the gear and kept sliding.*
*he grabbed hold of the thin metal rod at the center of the gear.*
*his hand jerked taught be it kept him from going over the edge.*
~He clung to that twisting rod, just taking a moment to breathe.~
*He Looked up at Martha - then down below him...*
*he started inching his way toward a gear further up that pole.*
~it was one  he could land on.~
"I’ll come get you!"
*Martha said - and he raised one hand to stop her.*
*And Martha stopped in her tracks.*
~She watched him make his way to the safe landing.~
}
{
`['Why didn’t he twist onto the face?
She wondered - was he in danger?', 
'oh shit, there’s that thing']`
~Below Kent was a dark figure with a tail.~
*it crawled on all fours towards them - the alien...*
'no...'
~she reminded herself.~
'that’s only a mask.'
'A very convincing mask...'
*she shuddered.*
~she hated that movie...~
~well: the second one with how they put people in those nests.~
*Kent dropped down with a thud.*
}
{
*He brushed himself off.*
"Keep going, it’s behind you"
*Martha cried out.*
*Kent looked behind him - seeing the thing only a few gears away.*
*He rushed toward the side.*
*Twisting onto the teeth, and making his way back toward her.*
~Martha could only watch.~
~the alien was closing in - he wasn’t going to make it.~
~She saw the ripple of gears around her -~
"ripple!"
*she shouted - and Kent held onto the gear.*
}
{
~The thing was right behind him.~
*the gear flung back and the alien’s tail caught in the gears behind it.*
*It cried out in a shrieking hiss.*
~The metal itself hissed and fumed loudly as the acid poured down over it.~
*Kent got to his feet and ran.*
*The gears slowly released the alien just as Kent rushed up to her.*
~carefully he moved past her - and took the lead again.~
}
{
~The tail of the creature leaked acid.~
~smoke rose up each time it dropped onto the gears.~
~Martha noticed another ripple.~
*she shouted and they both took cover.*
~The alien was thrown off the same way Kent had been a moment earlier.~
~it didn't follow them.~
*instead it started climbing back up the face of this gear.*
}
{
*Kent took her hand and they jumped across onto the face of the gear.*
~This one was lit differently, bluer - lighter...~
~She looked up to see a lack of any more gears to the left and right.~
~one above her connected to the same rod in the center of this gear.~
~All around her were stained glass windows.~
*He took off his jacket - gave it to her.*
*then he took off his shirt.*
*he wrapped it around the rod, then tied it around his wrists.*
*He sat down with his legs crossed around the pillar and hugged it.*
*suddenly pulled against it: he started climbing.*
*She did the same with the jacket.*
~the sleeves just long enough to tie in a knot around her arms.~
*She crossed her legs around the pillar and made her way up.*
~half way to the top her gravity shifted.~
}
{
*The alien - the thing, landed on the gear where they just were.*
~There was a loud clattering.~
~she felt the pole she was climbing spin violently.~
~the gear below was loose.~
~It gave way into the darkness just as a claw grabbed the rod.~
~It’s gravity had not changed and it was struggling to hold on.~
~To her right she saw a tooth from the gear above her fall.~
~it grazed the creature’s claw.~
~Spilling acid blood that dripped onto the metal rod.~
~As it climbed, pieces of the metal dripped away.~
~eventually leaving only it’s two front claws any purchase to keep climbing.~
*Martha kept moving as she looked down.*
~slowly she was growing the distance between them and the thing below.~
~They reached the top gear, sliding onto it.~
}
{
*Kent motioned to follow and he and Martha wrapped around the edge to the top.*
~A small marble laid at the center, faintly glowing.~
~A cat’s eye which caught the light.~
*it spun in a small recess at the center of the gear.*
~it glowed brighter and the gear began to spin.~
*Martha was spun nearly to the edge.*
}
{
~At her foot another tooth fell - she looked around.~
~only three were left - scattered across the perimeter.~
*She rushed to the center and grabbed the marble.*
~That’s what she was here for - that’s the only thing that didn’t fit.~
~Inspecting it she couldn’t find anything out of the ordinary with it.~
~other than it’s glow.~
*She rolled it in her hand and there...*
~that same kind of symbol.~
~different but undulating and twisting the same way as the one in the book.~
}
{
~But her hand was too small to make it out...~
*she bent down to roll it across the ground.*
~but before she could - the ground lurched beneath her feet.~
*the marble slipped from her hand.*
*Kent with one hand grabbed the marble. *
*with the other he grabbed Martha's shirt.*
~He was on the other side of the center and together they stayed close.~
~Ahead of her - she saw another tooth fall.~
"Roll it to me"
*she said, moving near the edge,*
"quickly"
*he complied and she watched it roll.*
~the shape inside.~
~barely even inside twisted and morphed through a repeating pattern.~
~A pattern that burned in her brain.~
~it was circular, and repeated itself.~
~a story she didn’t understand looped over and over...~
~as old as time itself.~
*She caught the marble, rushing back toward the center.*
~In front of her she saw a claw reach over the edge of the gear.~
~the metal sizzled beneath it.~
"We have to go now, how do we get out of here?"
*she asked - nodding behind her.*
*Kent looked around - reached out his hand.*
*He then nodded his head toward the edge of the gear.*
*Another lurching threw them both towards the creature...*
~not directly at it: off to it’s side.~
*They rolled over the edge and felt gravity shift.*
*they landed on the bear gear - where teeth used to be.*
~Martha saw themselves reflected in creature's eyes.~
~it was so close.~
*Both of them rolled back onto the top of the gear, almost out of it’s reach.*
*it grabbed Kent’s face - with the cut hand.*
*Acid poured onto him and he let out a silent scream.*
*She pulled him away.*
*Laying him down she dabbed at his face with the only rag she had.*
~the jacket she still had tied to her arms.~
~Most of it was gone now but the damage done.~
~his face horribly ruined.~
~and it was still sizzling - hissing.~
*she dabbed at it again, unable to wipe it away, more just wiping it around.*
*she threw the jacket away.*
~it too hissed and steamed and gurgled.~
~like his face.~
~he wasn't moving anymore - but he was still breathing.~
~The creature was climbing up now.~
*she dragged kent over to the other side of the small gear.*
*She felt the lurch again and she jumped with all her strength.*
~with Kent - the navigator - in tow.~
*She flew over the edge just as the alien climbed fully atop the gear.*
*She fell - down.*
~there were no more gears - just remnants of where they once had been.~
~a few golden rods jutted out from the walls,~
~several just narrowly missed them.~
*They continued to fall into the blackness.*
~down below where there were no more rods.~
~And she noticed a flicker of purple in the background.~
~The darkness faded into a misty grey.~
~Twisting about her as a mist - the storm growing.~
~Thunder echoed all around her in the distance.~
*lightning struck just a few feet away from them.*
~it crackled and made all the hair on her skin stand up.~
~and a ringing in her ears.~
}
{
~They fell through the barrier - silence engulfed them.~
~Kent wasn’t moving - she was still holding on tight to him.~
~They landed on the deck of the ship.~
~Captain alacira standing there.~
~Whitewater behind her.~
*Martha knelt over Kent.*
"he’s hurt,"
~he didn’t get up...~
~he didn’t move.~
*Alacira rushed over - and moved her out of the way.*
}
{
"We got it from here."
*She shouted for a medic and one came in rushed in from below deck.*
~a doctor with a big black purse - the kind from Victorian times.~
*he bent over to see Kent - pushing Martha back onto her feet.*
"Did you get it?"
*she asked, looking back up at Martha, who nodded.*
*the marble left from her pocket to her hand then to Alacira who inspected it.*
}
{
"Good job...
He’ll be fine."
*she looked behind her and nodded, *
"send her back"
*Martha turned around.*
~Behind her was a giant tribal mask.~
*It was shaking back and forth - behind it was Gerald’s voice going:*
"uhh ga booga booga!"
~startling her awake.~
}
{
~The plane was landing.~
