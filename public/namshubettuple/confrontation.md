"F::Have you seen this man"
*Felix grabbed at the back of the next person's shoulder, and pushed his phone in their face*
~It was the 9th one~
'K::Keep it cool Kent'
~Felix using the phone irked Kent~
~He had what happened to Tom still fresh in his mind~
'K::It was earlier... no, it was yesterday morning'
'K::How long have I been awake'
~Felix was just asking a question, and putting a memory of the thief's face in their brain~
~It wasn't mind control~
'K::Or so he tells me'
~Kent silently fumed~
'K::I had nothing better, it was this or blind searching'
*The 10th person pointed down the street*
*Felix turned to Kent and gestured with his head to hurry up*
~It went on like that, about one in ten would have seen him, pointing to where they last saw him go~
'K::how far can he go, he has a shopping cart'
*They walked around a street corner*
~The cityscape looming above them~
~They were directed into an alley~
~There he was: leaning over his cart walking out of the alley~
~He had just come out of some line - leading to a makeshift structure of card board boxes~
*Felix fiddled with his phone, then reached up to push it in the thief's face*
"K::No. None of that."
*Kent snatched the phone out of Felix's grip*
"F::What the fuck - how else are you going to get that syringe"
"HM::That was your syringe - I thought it was just another street syringe"
*Kent put the phone in his pocket*
"K::We want it back!"
"F::Did you take it?"
"HM::Did I take it?! 
A street syringe? 
I didn't stick no street syringe, that would be crazy"
"K::Do you have it with you?"
"HM::I took that shit to my chemist friend, he going to reverse engineer that shit and make us a billion dollars, baby"
"F::A billion dollars?"
"HM::You see that color it is? it's ain't a natural color"
"K::Where's your chemist friend?"
"HM::He's right back there - in the refrigerator boxes"
*Kent leaned to his right to get a better view around the man*
~Behind  was a line of homeless, exchanging things at a window in the cardboard~
~The cardboard structure was several dozen refrigerator-sized (or larger) boxes attached in a row~
~The alley was bowed, and from the street looking in: it was near invisible~
'K::The fuck am I looking at here.'
~Kent looked closer at the window~
~Everything and anything was being exchanged: for cash~
"HM::You want a cut of the billion dollars?"
"K::How about you take us to your chemist, and we have a nice chat?"
"HM::What you got ulterior motives or something, or you just want the syringe"
~There was a brief pause~
"HM::Cause if I shout - all the gangs are going to come"
"K::No, we just want the syringe"
"HM::Right, then this way"
*They entered the cardboard structure though a side 'door*
~It was guarded, Kent surrendered Felix's phone to his protest~
~Inside, beyond piles of things, cardboard hallways, piles of cash, and several zoned out people, was the Chemist~
~The chemist sat in a yellow sofa in the back, watching things attached to a fan spin above him~
~He was the only one in the room, which was filled with various household chemicals~
"HM::So these are the owners of that syringe - come to have a little chat, I'll just see myself out."
*The homeless man turned his cart around and left the way they came*
"K::We'll be on our way shortly - once we have it back"
~Kent looked more around the room~
~Things he took for scrapes of metal and glass on the desk to the right were actually improvised beakers and distilling gear~
'K::Hm... all that cash and this...'
*Felix walked up to the chemist*
~The chemist lay there unmoving, staring at the spinning items on strings attached to the fan blades~
~The glimmer caught Kent's eye~
~It was the same glimmer he had seen before, that impossible color~
"K::There"
*Kent pointed to the spinning fan*
'K::Just take it and go'
*An alarm buzzed*
*The Chemist jumped up and pulled the string to stop the fan*
~He noticed Kent and Felix~
"C::Hello, what can i do you for?"
*The Chemist plucked the vial of strange liquid and placed it on his desk*
*He moved a prism and shown a light though both the vial and the prism*
*He took notes in a pad to his right*
"K::What you've got there"
"C::This is interesting, do you know what this stuff is?"
*Felix raised is arm out to stop Kent*
"F::What is it?"
