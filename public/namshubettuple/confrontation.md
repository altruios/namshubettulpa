"J::We would be together too..."
~Jochek and Lenny had just arrived at the airport~
~She was in the passenger seat~
~They had no luggage~
"L::Flanagan said no link: means no link. 
Besides, we can't move it through the link."
*Jochek made a cutting motion with her hands*
"J::Half the time, and the three of us would be together now. 
Do you know how long a plane trip between here and Romania is."
*Lenny gripped the wheel tighter*
"J::I got you."
*Jochek grabbed his shoulder*
~His tension released~
*He let out a sigh*
"L::Okay. 
But we're going to be quick...
We'll find some people close to her, put them in our bodies while we get back to New York."
"J::Sounds fine..."
*Jochek smiled, and air-quoted*
"J:: 'Our bodies' "
*Jochek leaned in closer*
"L:: 'I' put a lot of work into this body - it's mine if I say it is."
"J::I am not my body, neither are you."
*She pressed a finger into his chest*
"L::I didn't say I was, I'm saying I expended a lot of energy to..."
~She loved getting him flustered~
"L::Talking is so faulty - so inefficient... so many syllables"
"J::Then come here"
*She pulled him into a kiss*
*Then into something deeper*
~The creature humans are cells to~
~It was and was the not Relux, with a missing third...~
~Jochek and Lenny of the Lux slid in the Link~

"F::Have you seen this man"
*Felix twisted the fellow around*
~He was momentarily offended~
*Felix then placed his phone in their face*
~It was the 9th time~
'K::Keep it cool Kent'
~Kent watched the stranger's eye twitch~
~Felix using his phone irked Kent~
~He had what happened to Tom still fresh in his mind~
'K::It was earlier... no, it was yesterday morning'
'K::How long have I been awake'
~Felix was just asking a question, and putting a memory of the thief's face in their brain~
~It wasn't mind control~
'K::Or so he tells me'
~Kent silently fumed~
'K::I had nothing better, it was this or blind searching'
*The 10th person pointed down the street*
*Felix turned to Kent and gestured with his head to hurry up*
~It went on like that, about one in ten would have seen him, pointing to where they last saw him go~
'K::How far can he go, he has a shopping cart'
*They walked around a corner, down another street*
'K::All downhill'
~The cityscape looming above them~
~They were directed into an alley~
~There he was: leaning over his cart~
*He pushed his shopping cart down the alley towards kent*
~He had just come out of some line - leading to a makeshift structure Kent had a poor view of~
*Felix fiddled with his phone, then reached up to push it in the thief's face*
"K::No, none of that."
*Kent snatched the phone out of Felix's grip*
"F::What the fuck - how else are you going to get that syringe"
"HM::That was your syringe - I thought it was just another street syringe"
*Kent put the phone in his pocket*
"K::We want it back!"
"F::Did you take it?"
"HM::Did I take it?! 
A street syringe? 
I didn't stick no street syringe, that would be crazy"
"K::Do you have it with you?"
"HM::I took that shit to my chemist friend, he going to reverse engineer that shit and make us a billion dollars, baby"
"F::A billion dollars?"
"HM::You see that color it is? it's ain't a natural color"
"K::Where's your chemist friend?"
"HM::He's right back there - in the refrigerator boxes"
*Kent leaned to his right to get a better view around the man*
~Behind  was a line of homeless, exchanging things at a window in the cardboard~
~The cardboard structure was several dozen refrigerator-sized (or larger) boxes attached in a row~
~The alley was bowed, and from the street looking in: it was near invisible~
'K::The fuck am I looking at here.'
~Kent looked closer at the window~
~Everything and anything was being exchanged: for cash~
"HM::You want a cut of the billion dollars?"
"K::How about you take us to your chemist, and we have a nice chat?"
"HM::What you got ulterior motives or something, or you just want the syringe"
~There was a brief pause~
"HM::Cause if I shout - all the gangs are going to come"
"K::No, we just want the syringe"
"HM::Right, then this way"
*They entered the cardboard structure though a side 'door'*
~It was guarded~
*Kent surrendered Felix's phone to his protest*
~Inside, beyond piles of things, cardboard hallways, piles of cash, and several zoned out people, was the Chemist~
~The chemist, a short balding man, sat in a yellow sofa in the back, watching things attached to a fan spin above him~
~He was the only one in the room, which was filled with various household chemicals~
~The floor was still asphalt, but it had a large rug, red and gold, covering most of the room~
"HM::So these are the owners of that syringe - come to have a little chat, I'll just see myself out."
*The homeless man turned his cart around and left the way they came*
"K::We'll be on our way shortly - once we have it back"
~Kent looked more around the room~
~Things he took for scrapes of metal and glass on the desk to the right were actually improvised beakers and distilling gear~
'K::Hm... all that cash and this...'
~A steel door in a brick building was one of the walls~
*Felix walked up to the chemist*
~The chemist lay there unmoving, staring at the spinning items on strings attached to the fan blades~
~The glimmer caught Kent's eye~
~It was the same glimmer he had seen before, that impossible color~
"K::There"
*Kent pointed to the spinning fan*
'K::Just take it and go'
*An alarm buzzed*
*The Chemist jumped up and pulled the string to stop the fan*
~He noticed Kent and Felix~
"C::Hello, what can I do you for?"
*The Chemist plucked the vial of strange liquid and placed it on his desk*
*He moved a prism and shown a light though both the vial and the prism*
*He took notes in a pad to his right*
"K::What you have there, is ours actually..."
"C::Yours... 
Interesting, Then you know what this stuff is?"
*Felix raised his arm out to stop Kent*
"F::What is it?"
*The chemist held the vial up to them*
~Kent looked around but did not see the original syringe~
~A few cardboard boxes tall, a tower supported a desk fan - wet rags attached to the grill~
'K::Two fans, wait? a ceiling fan?!'
~The roof was cardboard~
"C::I'mm'a be real with you, first though: if you don't know what this is: where the hell did you get it?"
*The chemist put it back on the table and swept it between the light and the prism*
~The vial's shadow on the rainbow was not an absence of light - but an inversion of the color, a photo-negative~
"K::Took it from a cult, they wanted me to take it, not steal it, take it..."
"F::Alice Glass made it."
*The chemist's hand paused*
"C::Did she now?"
*The chemist reached in a cardboard box next to the table*
~After some rummaging the chemist had on gloves~
"C::So you know what this is?"
"K::Not really."
"F::We were heading to Flanagan's to take it to get analyzed."
"K::Why are we telling you so much?"
"C::That would be the truth mist."
*Kent looked up*
'K::The wet rags attached to the fan'
"K::Truth mist?"
"C::Chemistry, baby"
*The chemist let out a cough*
"C::Strictly speaking not just a truth mist...
Also pacifies... 
And gets you a little high"
*Kent looked at his hands*
~He didn't feel different, not to himself at least~
"C::Anyways - This stuff."
*He held out a syringe*
"C::This - is like the electron shell being around the wrong nucleus.   
It's wrong but it still works, like there's something else balancing the scale."
~Kent looked around the cardboard room~
'K::He has to be bullshitting. 
Where is the equipment?'
"K::And you can tell all this, how?"
"C::So here..."
*The chemist pointed to inverted section of the rainbow*
"C::You know what color is..."
"K::Yeah, I've seen trees of green"
"F::Red roses too"
~He added flatly~
"C::Color happens in our brain.
The photon never reaches our brain.
Instead a photon hits one of our photoreceptor, travels as an electrical signal to the back of the brain..."
*The chemist leaned in*
"C::And that signal - is color, it is our brain picking up a signal - and as you can see, it is the opposite of what we would expect.
Where we expect dark there is light, expect a color and get the inversion"
"K::That's definitive?"
"C::I'll have results from the lab soon, I've only had this ten minutes."
"F::Lab?"
"C::Right in the building we're attached to."
"K::Is your lab?"
"C::What, you think I work out of here."
*Kent looked to Felix, who shrugged*
"K::Also: what is this place?"
"C::A front... 
A cardboard front"
"K::A front to what?"
"C::I'm a chemist.
It's a front for chemistry."
*A door opened to their right*
"C::That would be one of my assistants with the spectrometry report"
"K::You did tests that fast?"
'K::Yep, speech is slurred'
"C::This is a clandestine lab - not the dmv, now: want to see?"
~Kent was curious, but he was tired, the 'truth mist' wasn't helping him stay awake~
"C::Now, you mean me any harm?"
*Felix shook his head*
"F::You us?"
*The chemist shook his head*
"C::I am aware, not awake, but aware... I intend to stay that way"
*Felix paused, then reached out his hand*
~Shadows swam in the corner of Kent's vision~
"F::We intended to bring back that."
~The chemist gave Felix a hard stare~
"C::We can both get what we intend"
*Kent balled his hands and pushed his nails into his palms*
~Only to keep himself awake~
*The chemist handed Felix the vial*
*Felix nodded slowly*
~Kent's fingers loosened~
"C::Now that that's done, shall we?"
*The chemist pointed to his lab entrance*
~His knees no longer had the strength~
*Kent fell down*
~He slipped into sleep with his face resting on a persian rug layed out on the asphalt~

*Martha walked down the book alley, to a clearing*
~To Martha's left was the console prompt rossin had made for her~
`
spear = ~Self~.~Hands (left)~.~Objects[0]~
Global.setTrigger(
    doesExist(ref), (ref)=> spear.heart = ref

        ).filter(x=> x != ~Martha Crisp~)
    )
`
~She let her focus drift forward, bringing her closer to the present moment~
*The console faded from view*
~She felt the hand pulling her into the clearing~
'M::Okay, is that it?'
~She went over everything in her head, again~
'M::That should be it...'
*She entered the clearing*
*Flanagan was by her side*
~In front of her was herself, reading a book, next to a woman~
~The woman was ancient, crumpled by time, and a stranger to the sun~
*As She and Flanagan stepped forward the woman vanished*
~Flanagan wore a frown~
*Martha and Flanagan approached herself*
~Herself was sitting at the corner window table~
~As they drew near, the rest of Martha's view became an echo, a projected reflection of herself~
"FL::We're here at the edge, right through here is our target."
*Martha nodded and stepped forward*
"M::Why is it here at all, at this book store, where I am?"
~Herself was a door, all around her~ 
"FL::She was here."
`
[the spider](the-spider.md)`
*Which she stepped though, Flanagan holding her hand*
~They were in the book store still, now outside of Martha's head~
~The shelves shimmered softly - the shifting projections of minds looking at those books were in subtle conflict~
~It was open currently, 7:30PM, and people were in the aisles~
~Martha saw though their eyes, a projected map of the store.~
~It was filled out with memories of what the rest looked like.~
~Dreams of what it should look like~
~All alined to make a landscape as solid as shifting scarves~
*Martha waded through the floor, following Flanagan*
'M::Too thick'
~She concentrated and iterations of the floor, the aisles, fell away~
~She saw only what other's saw of the store~
~And the floor was solid, but incomplete~
~Instead of filling out the idea, patching an unseen bit of floor with a memory, there was nothing but a hole~
~The hole from her childhood dreams~
*A twisting, undulating mass slithered in the empty black*
~Both known and impossible to see~
"M::I found it."
~Flanagan was at her side, looking at the darkness~
~They stood at a ledge into that void, a broken bit of floor and wall unseen in the corner~
"FL::It hasn't seen us yet"
~Flanagan whispered~
"FL::We can't assume we'll be lucky, at some point it will see us, follow behind me - I'll distract it, you go around and poke it"
~Martha nodded and tightened her grip on her spear~
'M::Here goes...'
"FL::Quickly now."
*Martha and Flanagan fell into darkness*
~The instinctual part of her panicked - going from stability to this~
~It wasn't merely a void - but an inevitably~
~There was no hallway, no bookstore left, all directions pointed to al-tok~
*Flanagan and Martha fell some distance*
~Obeying strange laws of gravity, regardless of the direction they were falling - they were getting closer~
*Flanagan nodded to her and shouted in the void*
"FL::To your left, hurry!"
*Martha pushed off of him and fell to her left*
~Still falling towards Al-tok~
~Flanagan grew more noticeable, brighter~
~He was both behind her where she left him, and all around her - in some reflected pattern~
*Around her tentacles shot towards Flanagan*
~They were barbarous and leaking something corrosive~
*He conjured lines of blinding yellow light*
~Wrapping the tentacles together~
~Martha kept as still as she could and silently fell towards her target~
*A tentacle nearly collided with her and forced her to move*
~As she twirled in the blackness she readied her spear~
*A tentacle slammed into Flanagan - who screamed*
'M::They are as painful as they look'
~The yellow lines of light faded, then surged~
*Flanagan was screaming, not in pain but in rage*
~The yellow lines started melting, coating the tentacles with a rubbery glue~
*Martha took a breath. Aimed. Then threw her spear*
*It flew forward - breaking into a fractal all around her as it did so*
'M::Damn jet-pack would be convenient right about now'
~She was forming the grammar to summon one and saw Flanagan with out~
'M::Or I could just give myself flying.'
`~Self~.*Flying*=true`
~It was what every dream said it would be, as such, she flew with years of dreamt precision~
~She kept her eye on the descending spear~
*A tentacle shot out in its path*
*The spear glanced off at the ^collision, twisting off angle*
~She felt the impact in her heart~
~And her heart dropped, that was just a glancing blow - and in a second~
*Martha faltered in time with Flanagan*
*The spear slammed on it's side, bouncing uselessly against a thick carapace*
~Martha knew Flanagan felt that impact~
*She looked back at him*
'M::He thinks it is only him'
~She couldn't affect the spear, out of her grasp - on the thing in front of her~
~She had to get to that spear, she raced through some options in her mind~
*She flew down to get it*
'M::Okay, force-field, and something grabby'
~She was almost there, having dodged every tentacle easily thus far~
'M::Maybe that will draw attention to me'
~She hesitated, but decided against summoning anything, keeping it ready in her mind~
*She paused just before touching the surface*
~All around her tentacles shifted like:~
'M::Wiggling spaghetti'
~From this perspective everything in the horizon was al-tok, Flanagan a lonely figure in the distance~
~Long strands stretched from all around her toward Flanagan, focused entirely on him~
*She grabbed the spear, gripped the handle and stabbed down at the carapace*
~A clink echoed throughout, reverberating a wave through the surface of al-tok~
~It didn't penetrate~
'M::Shit...okay, something tougher than super-sharp carbon-fiber'
*She took the spear and moved across the surface*
~A short while later she noticed activity where she had been~
~She was getting noticed~
'M::Now or never'

}
{
*Around her, tentacles started to shift*
*She looked up*
~Toward her, tentacles out of Flanagan's reach raced toward her~
*She slammed the spear down*
~There was a terrible screeching sound~
*It slid in*
~Like butter~
`dome-shield = Globals.fan^-@$%`
~She felt her rib crack~
*^A Tentacle sent her flying to the side*
~While her shield was impenetrable, it had no particular force distribution... so while the thorn/tooth did not puncture her, it had an sharp edge~
*Her breath shot out from her*
~As she flew away from the spear, she could see it was still attached~
*She landed in a thud, against al-tok*
~The carapace morphed into a black liquid pool thick as molasses~
*She sunk*
~Each struggle to get out, pushed her further down~
*She looked over at the spear - it was still attached, un-noticed*
~She saw Flanagan falter, then fall, succumb to the effects of the sudden rush of Algera~
*Martha looked closer*
~She saw Flanagan fall on to some sort of ball - they were too far too see, but he didn't bounce~
'M::Hamster ball?'
*It was flying toward her, dodging the tentacles on it's way down*
~But it wasn't going to make it in time~
~She was half stuck in the tar-like fluid~
*She stopped struggling*
~It was heading right for her~
~As it drew closer she could see it was clear, and it held two men, one along the floor and one in the center piloting~
~She recognized him, the Captain's first officer, Gerald~
"M::Over here!"
*The bubble was zipping toward her*
~He sat in a chair in the center of the bubble, a victorian contraption attached him to the floor of the bubble~
~That was the last she saw before she was engulfed~
*She held her breath*
~Her rib seared in pain, like a burning knife was still stuck~
*Something slithered around her ankle and pulled her down further*
*Martha held her mouth and nose closed and sunk deeper*
~She felt nothing against her skin directly~
~Still, she didn't want to take the chance of anything getting in her lungs to a misplaced cough~
'M::Anchor'
~Martha still felt the slight tugging in her hand~
'M::He is holding my hand...'
~She thought of the bubble she saw him fall into~
~She saw her hand disintegrate and that unraveling expanded to the rest of her~
}

{
~The next thing she knew she was on the floor next to Flanagan, who was unconscious~
~Her vision was still a faint blue, her shield still around her~
"G::Good, I don't have to come get you."
*Gerald pulled on a lever next to the seat he was in*
~She felt heavier as the gravity shifted~
*A tentacle tried to impale the bubble, but it just spun*
~The interior platform Martha and Gerald were standing on stayed stationary~
"G::None of that now."
*Gerald pulled down on a lever next to him*
*They shot outwards from al-tok*
~Martha saw distant tentacles attached to different thoughts, ideas...~
~It wasn't just in her book store, she saw... but it was attached to memories of libraries, and university studies~
~She got the sense it was searching for something~
'M::It was doing this all while we were down there'
~Flanagan was at her feet, wounded~
*Martha tried to breath, instead she coughed*
*She touched at her side*
~It was tender~
`['Do I need to go to a hospital?', 'Am I an idea here, can I just fix myself?']`
~She tried~

    ]
`
~And it worked~
*Her bones let out a snap as they bound together*
~A coldness left her stomach and her heart as a heat rushed into her bruised rib~
~It healed rapidly, but she was immediately hungry, worse... starving~
~She was breathing rapidly~
~She had not accounted for the energy use of healing, there's a reason people stay in bed for it~
~She felt her skin as if it were fire~
~Everything that could easily burn away for fuel was done so, at such a rapid pace martha started coughing up large bits of a dark grey matter~
*She stopped heaving and lay still for a while*
~Much thinner than what she had been, but now with a healed bone~
"G::Are you alright?"
"M::I am, hungry"
~Gerald looked her over and saw her condition~
"G::Good excuse to use this"
*He pushed down on the lever to his left and got out of the chair*
~It seemed to be on some automatic setting~
~Martha looked around and saw they were about to land on a familiar ship~
*Gerald took a knife*
~He spoke words and oddly, she didn't hear them~
"G::I'm going to give you some of my fat - free energy"
*Martha nodded her head*
"G::Lower your shield"
*She did so, and winced when he took the blade across his hand*
*He made a small incision on her side and placed his hand there*
~His arm rippled and bulged as did her side~
~Each breath she took was a little easier, her thoughts clearer~
*She sat up*
*He wiped at his hand and the cut was gone, he did the same at her side to the same effect*
"G::You've got a lot to learn, but considering you started yesterday - I'd say you're off to a good start"
*He stepped out of the bubble*
~The thin layer wobbled back and forth with his passing~
*She looked back to Flanagan*
"G::Quickly, we don't have all day - I'm afraid"
*She pointed to Flanagan*
"G::We'll take care of him.
Just get to the captain."
*Martha checked his pulse* 
~Which was fine~
*She left the bubble*
