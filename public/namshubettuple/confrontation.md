"J::We would be together too..."
~Jochek and Lenny had just arrived at the airport~
"L::No link, means no link, besides - we can't get it back through the link."
"J::Half the time, and we would be together now."
*Lenny gripped the wheel tighter*
"J::I got you."
*Jochek grabbed his shoulder*
~His tension released~
*He let out a sigh*
"L::Okay. 
But we're going to be quick...
We'll find some people close to her, put them in our bodies while we get back to new york."
"J::Sounds fine..."
*Jochek smiled*
"J::'Our bodies'"
*Jochek leaned in closer*
"L::'I' put a lot of work into this body - it's mine if I say it is."
"J::I am not my body, neither are you."
*She pressed a finger into his chest*
"L::I didn't say I was, I'm saying I expended a lot of energy to... talking is so faulty - so inefficient... so many syllables"
"J::Then come here"
*She pulled him into a kiss*
*Then into something deeper*
~The creature humans are cells to~
~It was and was the not Relux, with a missing third...~
~Jochek and Lenny of the Lux slid in the Link~

mn:K
"F::Have you seen this man"
*Felix grabbed at the back of the next person's shoulder, and pushed his phone in their face*
~It was the 9th one~
'K::Keep it cool Kent'
~Felix using the phone irked Kent~
~He had what happened to Tom still fresh in his mind~
'K::It was earlier... no, it was yesterday morning'
'K::How long have I been awake'
~Felix was just asking a question, and putting a memory of the thief's face in their brain~
~It wasn't mind control~
'K::Or so he tells me'
~Kent silently fumed~
'K::I had nothing better, it was this or blind searching'
*The 10th person pointed down the street*
*Felix turned to Kent and gestured with his head to hurry up*
~It went on like that, about one in ten would have seen him, pointing to where they last saw him go~
'K::how far can he go, he has a shopping cart'
*They walked around a street corner*
~The cityscape looming above them~
~They were directed into an alley~
~There he was: leaning over his cart walking out of the alley~
~He had just come out of some line - leading to a makeshift structure of card board boxes~
*Felix fiddled with his phone, then reached up to push it in the thief's face*
"K::No. None of that."
*Kent snatched the phone out of Felix's grip*
"F::What the fuck - how else are you going to get that syringe"
"HM::That was your syringe - I thought it was just another street syringe"
*Kent put the phone in his pocket*
"K::We want it back!"
"F::Did you take it?"
"HM::Did I take it?! 
A street syringe? 
I didn't stick no street syringe, that would be crazy"
"K::Do you have it with you?"
"HM::I took that shit to my chemist friend, he going to reverse engineer that shit and make us a billion dollars, baby"
"F::A billion dollars?"
"HM::You see that color it is? it's ain't a natural color"
"K::Where's your chemist friend?"
"HM::He's right back there - in the refrigerator boxes"
*Kent leaned to his right to get a better view around the man*
~Behind  was a line of homeless, exchanging things at a window in the cardboard~
~The cardboard structure was several dozen refrigerator-sized (or larger) boxes attached in a row~
~The alley was bowed, and from the street looking in: it was near invisible~
'K::The fuck am I looking at here.'
~Kent looked closer at the window~
~Everything and anything was being exchanged: for cash~
"HM::You want a cut of the billion dollars?"
"K::How about you take us to your chemist, and we have a nice chat?"
"HM::What you got ulterior motives or something, or you just want the syringe"
~There was a brief pause~
"HM::Cause if I shout - all the gangs are going to come"
"K::No, we just want the syringe"
"HM::Right, then this way"
*They entered the cardboard structure though a side 'door'*
~It was guarded~
*Kent surrendered Felix's phone to his protest*
~Inside, beyond piles of things, cardboard hallways, piles of cash, and several zoned out people, was the Chemist~
~The chemist, a short balding man, sat in a yellow sofa in the back, watching things attached to a fan spin above him~
~He was the only one in the room, which was filled with various household chemicals~
"HM::So these are the owners of that syringe - come to have a little chat, I'll just see myself out."
*The homeless man turned his cart around and left the way they came*
"K::We'll be on our way shortly - once we have it back"
~Kent looked more around the room~
~Things he took for scrapes of metal and glass on the desk to the right were actually improvised beakers and distilling gear~
'K::Hm... all that cash and this...'
~A steel door in a brick building was one of the walls~
*Felix walked up to the chemist*
~The chemist lay there unmoving, staring at the spinning items on strings attached to the fan blades~
~The glimmer caught Kent's eye~
~It was the same glimmer he had seen before, that impossible color~
"K::There"
*Kent pointed to the spinning fan*
'K::Just take it and go'
*An alarm buzzed*
*The Chemist jumped up and pulled the string to stop the fan*
~He noticed Kent and Felix~
"C::Hello, what can I do you for?"
*The Chemist plucked the vial of strange liquid and placed it on his desk*
*He moved a prism and shown a light though both the vial and the prism*
*He took notes in a pad to his right*
"K::What you have there, is ours actually..."
"C::Yours... 
interesting, Then you know what this stuff is?"
*Felix raised is arm out to stop Kent*
"F::What is it?"
*The chemist held the vial up to them*
~Kent looked around but did not see the original syringe~
~A few cardboard boxes tall, a tower held a fan - wet rags attached to the grill~
"C::I'mm'a be real with you, first though: if you don't know what this is: where the hell did you get it?"
*The chemist put it back on the table and swept it between the light and the prism*
~The vial's shadow on the rainbow was not an absence of light - but an inversion of the color, a photo-negative~
"K::Took it from a cult, they wanted me to take it, not steal it, take it..."
"F::Alice Glass made it."
*The chemist's hand paused*
"C::Did she now?"
*The chemist reached in a cardboard box next to the table*
~After some rummaging the chemist had on gloves~
"C::So you know what this is?"
"K::Not really."
"F::We were heading to Flanagan's to take it to get analyzed."
"K::Why are we telling you so much?"
"C::That would be the truth mist."
*Kent looked up*
'K::The wet rags of the fan'
"K::Truth mist?"
"C::Chemistry, baby"
*The chemist let out a cough*
"C::Strictly speaking not just a truth mist...
Also pacifies... and gets you a little high"
*Kent looked at his hands*
~He didn't feel different, not to himself at least~
"C::Anyways - This stuff."
*He held out a syringe*
"C::This - is like the electron shell being around the wrong nucleus.   
It's wrong but it still works, like there's something else balancing the scale."
~Kent looked around the cardboard room~
'K::He has to be bullshitting. 
Where is the equipment?'
"K::And you can tell all this, how?"
"C::So here..."
*The chemist pointed to inverted section of the rainbow*
"C::You know what color is..."
"K::Yeah, I've seen trees of green"
"F::Red roses too"
"C::Color happens in our brain.
The photon never reaches our brain.
Instead a photon hits one of our photoreceptor, travels as an electrical signal to the back of the brain..."
*The chemist leaned in*
"C::And that signal - is color, it's our brain picking up a signal - and as you can see, it's the opposite of what we would expect.
Where we expect dark there is light, expect a color and get it's inversion"
"K::That's definitive?"
"C::I'll have results from the lab soon, I've only had this ten minutes."
"F::Lab?"
"C::Right in the building we're attached to."
"K::Is your lab?"
"C::What, you think I work out of here."
*Kent looked to Felix, who shrugged*
"K::Also: what is this place?"
"C::A front... 
A cardboard front"
"K::A front to what?"
"C::I'm a chemist.
It's a front for chemistry."
*A door opened to their right*
"C::That would be one of my assistants with the spectrometry report"
"K::You did tests that fast?"
"C::This is a clandestine lab - not the dmv, now: want to see?"
~Kent was curious, but he was tired, the 'truth mist' wasn't helping him stay awake~
"C::Now, you mean me any harm?"
*Felix shook his head*
"F::You us?"
*The chemist shook his head*
"C::I am aware, not awake, but aware... I intend to stay that way"
*Felix paused, then reached out his hand*
"F::We intended to bring back that."
~The chemist gave him a hard stare~
"C::We can both get what we intend"
*The chemist handed Felix the vial*
*Felix nodded slowly*
"C::Now that that's done, shall we?"
*The chemist pointed to his lab entrance*
