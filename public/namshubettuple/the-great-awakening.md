## the great awakening

{

mn:K
~Car alarms blared in the distance, echoing in the still air between buildings~
~The smell of smoke filled the air, acrid tire smoke~
*Kent moved over the unconscious homeless*
~Making way for his cart with the Chemist on it~
~Some clearly fell the wrong way~
'K::They said you were in over your head, Kent'
~After exiting the alley and approaching the street, Kent saw the fires~
~Cars were still running, but all of them crashed into each other - on the sides of streets~
'K::They were fucking right'
*Kent walked down the sidewalk, pushing the bed*
~He listened~
~There was no sound of life, no screams, yelling - no footfalls in the distance~
'K::An air-raid siren would be appropriate'
~He passed a wreck - a car rolled upside down after some impact~
~They were dead, he knew: the cabin had been crushed below human capacity~
~It was a family, he saw that much before he looked away~
"K::Hello!"
~It was screaming into the wind, but maybe~
~Kent was only around the first corner - he continued on~
~Behind him there was a whistle, loud and sharp: calling~
*Kent turned around*
~He didn't see the source~
"K::Hello?"
~He called out again~
*A flowerpot burst through a window of a steakhouse*
*Kent ducked behind a line of parked cars*
"F::Over here!"
~He waited and saw Felix poke his head out of the broken window~
'K::Why is he awake?'
~Then a sinking feeling in his stomach appeared~
'K::Did he cause this?'
~He decided that it couldn't have been solely Felix~
'K::No: to many people affected'
"K::What the hell is going on"
"F::No idea"
*Kent pushed the bed towards the steakhouse*
~Felix was at a window seat - eating a steak~
"F::Get some nice beauty sleep, did you?"
~Kent shook his head~
"K::Why aren't you asleep?"
*Felix took another bite of steak*
"F::disconnected - as much as one can be: I assume you are as well"
"K::Disconnected... from?"
"F::The link."
~Kent waited~
'K::The fuck is the link?'
"K::So what happened to the link?"
~He wanted to ask what it was, though felt that unwise~
*Felix shrugged*
"F::Don't know - Flanagan said to disconnect"
'K::Flanagan is a person, good to know'
"K::Are they going to wake up?"
"F::How should I know?"
*Kent parked the bed next to the door and entered the steakhouse*
~Little locking wheels on a hospital bed were useful~
'K::At least the Chemist will stay put'
"K::Who would know?"
"F::Flanagan, either this is him or that Al-tok thing."
~Kent waited~
"F::Did Martha tell you anything?"
*Kent shook his head*
~Felix sighed and spend the next several minutes catching Kent up to speed~
"K::So this Al-tok this is an idea?"
*Felix twisted his hand out noncommittally*
"F::It isn't human, or a human thought... well, not a natural human thought"
*Felix held out a syringe*
"F::Takes something like this to make anyone think that"
~Kent had a vial of that same liquid - hidden now in his pocket~
"F::impossible chemicals, for impossible thoughts"
"K::That sounds like bullshit, I can think anything I want to right now"
*Felix shook his head*
"F::No, you can't think any thought you want.
You can't. 
I can't. 
We can only think the thoughts our brains allow."
*Felix took another bite of his steak*
"F::You should eat - if they stay asleep - food won't keep forever."
"K::What you don't believe in free will?"
*Kent sat down at the table across from Felix*
~Kent just watched him eat~
"F::I do, I just don't think free means unrestricted."
"K::That's generally what free means"
"F::Generally"
~Felix took another mouthful of steak~
"K::Chew you goddamn food, people choke on that stuff"
"F::Aren't you going to eat?"
"K::I'll wait.
Shouldn't we be going?"
~Felix continued to talk around mouthfuls of meat~
"F::Yes, but calories first."
~Kent heard screaming in the distance~
*Felix turned his head*
~Listening~
~Kent felt something hit is leg by the ankle~
~Felix had knocked over some people sitting together to get at their food~
*Kent stood up*
*He dodged a twitch of a fallen patron's leg*
'K::They were waking up'
*Kent looked around the room*
~He found movement everywhere~
'K::All of them'

`{TODO: Martha directs them back to the 'real world'}`
`{rough outline:
    they be in the bubble, al-tok has spread.
    the link is 'wrong' al-tok is everywhere now
    they get back into martha's memory and from there near the cube.
    flanagan wakes up and opens the way through the cube
    the fish-man wilbert complains that he can only go outside on halloween
    flanagan admits martha was a sacrifice - to go to or bring a walker to deal with al-tok.
}`    
~It was cramped with seven people in the bubble~
~Martha was holding tightly to the chair in the center~
~They all were, due to the turbulence~
~Martha didn't see anything outside the bubble, a blank void~
~The bubble was shaking, as if unsure of it's position without any other points of reference~
~A shaky memory, shifting every time it was examined~
"G::I have some bad news, it's worse than we thought"
*Gerald pulled a lever up*
*The ship calmed*
"G::There's nothing out there, no where to go."
~A silence fell over them~
"M::I might have a way."
~Everyone turned their head to Martha, besides Wilbert, whose eye was already on her~
*Alacria rowed her hand*
~A gesture to continue~
"M::Well, Flanagan did: The way we came into the link, we should be able to get out the same way."
"G::Martha - when I say there's nothing out there, there is nothing, even if we have a way back we wouldn't be able to get to it right now."
"NT::$Ewhichway:"
"M::through me, through that thing in my head"
*Alacria leaned over and looked at the unconscious Flanagan*

    Lovelace is introduced.
    Background discourse is related to current events of the seizure illness.
    Lenny and Jochek are in other bodies - join with lovelace are relux again.
    some sort of obstacle?

~Ada walked through the halls~
'AD::What a golden opportunity'
~If she wanted she could peruse the library of mnemonic info-hazards~
~It was to her left as she walked down the hall~
~Her heels clacked on the red marble floor and echoed down an otherwise eerie silence~
~Above hung a sign, not of wood, but of fact~
*Dangerous!*
'AD::dangerous for a reason'
~The door had been left opened~
'AD::As long as I use the right filters'
*She looked in*
'AD::Naked facts hanging everywhere'
~Facts dangerous to understand, facts that could destroy minds~
~But with the right filters of perception - looked at from only a particular viewpoint - they were safe to consume~
*She continued on*
~Part of her wanted to know - things other's have tried to understand only to have been brought to madness~
~But she walked on, content in her brief encounter~
'AD::At least I get to enjoy this silence'
*She stepped over an body*
~Which occasionally spasmed~
~They all were: as far as she could tell at least~
'AD::which way...'
~To the vault of infectious memes~
'AD::The vocal fry bitch voice got out a few decades ago'
~It had been used as a tool to make someone who was aware (but not awakened) very rich~
'AD::If I cared about making money, or if any of my friends did'
~No, she decided - up the stairs~
'AD::onwards to the prize'
~The stairs were majestic, made of the same red tile~
*She climbed them*
~Upstairs was the sovereign's personal development environment~
~Even most people at the gathering didn't know about this room~
'AD::hell, most people who did know about this chose to forget'
~Not her though, she had to know, this and more~
*She entered a room*
~A bedroom - the bed was surrounded by a lake of water lined with mirror~
~And another door: behind which was the most dangerous place in this reality~
~As it edited this reality~
~The truth she knew and chose to remember was that this reality was just a dream in the link~
~A dream made solid by everyone's participation~
~That there was nothing but the link~
~That 'objective' reality was only a narrow part of the link~
~And that narrow part kept minds bound to it~
~And that room would edit not just that... but the link entire~
~So of course she had to at least look inside~
~She had to know~
~She heard footsteps from below~
"L::Hello!"
~The voice of a gruff carriage driver, one she didn't recognized~
'AD::quick peek, then get out of here'
*She walked to and opened the door*
~Beyond the door was a dark empty space - and in the center a flashing cursor~
`PW:<input id='input' style="background-color:inherit;color:green;border:none"></input><div id="key" max-height="10vh" overflow-x="scroll"></div>`
"AD::Password -well, of course"
