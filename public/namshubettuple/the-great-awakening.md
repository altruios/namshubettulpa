`{TODO: Kent wanders the world in transition - unsure of what he's seeing... someone wakes up and he sees whats what}`
`{rough outline:
    kent goes outside, everyone is still
    in his search for food he wanders by someone who wakes up, they begin acting strangely - talking to people kent can't see
    kent buys food from the store using a self checkout
    everyone wakes up - Kent observes them objectively in their own worlds.

{
`{TODO: Martha directs them back to the 'real world'}`
`{rough outline:
    they be in the bubble, al-tok has spread.
    the link is 'wrong' al-tok is everywhere now
    they get back into martha's memory and from there near the cube.
    flanagan wakes up and opens the way through the cube
    the fish-man wilbert complains that he can only go outside on halloween
    flanagan admits martha was a sacrifice - to go to or bring a walker to deal with al-tok.
