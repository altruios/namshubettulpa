## the great awakening

{

mn:K
~Car alarms blared in the distance, echoing in the still air between buildings~
~The smell of smoke filled the air, acrid tire smoke~
*Kent moved over the unconscious homeless*
~Making way for his cart with the Chemist on it~
~Some clearly fell the wrong way~
'K::They said you were in over your head, Kent'
~After exiting the alley and approaching the street, Kent saw the fires~
~Cars were still running, but all of them crashed into each other - on the sides of streets~
'K::They were fucking right'
*Kent walked down the sidewalk, pushing the bed*
~He listened~
~There was no sound of life, no screams, yelling - no footfalls in the distance~
'K::An air-raid siren would be appropriate'
~He passed a wreck - a car rolled upside down after some impact~
~They were dead, he knew: the cabin had been crushed below human capacity~
~It was a family, he saw that much before he looked away~
"K::Hello!"
~It was screaming into the wind, but maybe~
~Kent was only around the first corner - he continued on~
~Behind him there was a whistle, loud and sharp: calling~
*Kent turned around*
~He didn't see the source~
"K::Hello?"
~He called out again~
*A flowerpot burst through a window of a steakhouse*
*Kent ducked behind a line of parked cars*
"F::Over here!"
~He waited and saw Felix poke his head out of the broken window~
'K::Why is he awake?'
~Then a sinking feeling in his stomach appeared~
'K::Did he cause this?'
~He decided that it couldn't have been solely Felix~
'K::No: to many people affected'
"K::What the hell is going on"
"F::No idea"
*Kent pushed the bed towards the steakhouse*
~Felix was at a window seat - eating a steak~
"F::Get some nice beauty sleep, did you?"
~Kent shook his head~
"K::Why aren't you asleep?"
*Felix took another bite of steak*
"F::disconnected - as much as one can be: I assume you are as well"
"K::Disconnected... from?"
"F::The link."
~Kent waited~
'K::The fuck is the link?'
"K::So what happened to the link?"
~He wanted to ask what it was, though felt that unwise~
*Felix shrugged*
"F::Don't know - Flanagan said to disconnect"
'K::Flanagan is a person, good to know'
"K::Are they going to wake up?"
"F::How should I know?"
*Kent parked the bed next to the door and entered the steakhouse*
~Little locking wheels on a hospital bed were useful~
'K::At least the Chemist will stay put'
"K::Who would know?"
"F::Flanagan, either this is him or that Al-tok thing."
~Kent waited~
"F::Did Martha tell you anything?"
*Kent shook his head*
~Felix sighed and spend the next several minutes catching Kent up to speed~
"K::So this Al-tok this is an idea?"
*Felix twisted his hand out noncommittally*
"F::It isn't human, or a human thought... well, not a natural human thought"
*Felix held out a syringe*
"F::Takes something like this to make anyone think that"
~Kent had a vial of that same liquid - hidden now in his pocket~
"F::impossible chemicals, for impossible thoughts"
"K::That sounds like bullshit, I can think anything I want to right now"
*Felix shook his head*
"F::No, you can't think any thought you want.
You can't. 
I can't. 
We can only think the thoughts our brains allow."
*Felix took another bite of his steak*
"F::You should eat - if they stay asleep - food won't keep forever."
"K::What you don't believe in free will?"
*Kent sat down at the table across from Felix*
~Kent just watched him eat~
"F::I do, I just don't think free means unrestricted."
"K::That's generally what free means"
"F::Generally"
~Felix took another mouthful of steak~
"K::Chew you goddamn food, people choke on that stuff"
"F::Aren't you going to eat?"
"K::I'll wait.
Shouldn't we be going?"
~Felix continued to talk around mouthfuls of meat~
"F::Yes, but calories first."
~Kent heard screaming in the distance~
*Felix turned his head*
~Listening~
~Kent felt something hit is leg by the ankle~
~Felix had knocked over some people sitting together to get at their food~
*Kent stood up*
*He dodged a twitch of a fallen patron's leg*
'K::They were waking up'
*Kent looked around the room*
~He found movement everywhere~
'K::All of them'

`{TODO: Martha directs them back to the 'real world'}`
`{rough outline:
    they be in the bubble, al-tok has spread.
    the link is 'wrong' al-tok is everywhere now
    they get back into martha's memory and from there near the cube.
    flanagan wakes up and opens the way through the cube
    the fish-man wilbert complains that he can only go outside on halloween
    flanagan admits martha was a sacrifice - to go to or bring a walker to deal with al-tok.

~It was cramped with seven people in the bubble~
~Martha was holding tightly to the chair in the center~
~They all were, due to the turbulence~
~Martha didn't see anything outside the bubble, a blank void~
~The bubble was shaking, as if unsure of it's position without any other points of reference~
~A shaky memory, shifting every time it was examined~
"G::I have some bad news, it's worse than we thought"
*Gerald pulled a lever up*
*The ship calmed*
"G::There's nothing out there, no where to go."
~A silence fell over them~
"M::I might have a way."
~Everyone turned their head to Martha, besides Wilbert, whose eye was already on her~
*Alacria rowed her hand*
~A gesture to continue~
"M::Well, Flanagan did: The way we came into the link, we should be able to get out the same way."
"G::Martha - when I say there's nothing out there, there is nothing, even if we have a way back we wouldn't be able to get to it right now."
"NT::$Ewhichway:"
"M::through me, through that thing in my head"
*Alacria leaned over and looked at the unconscious Flanagan*
